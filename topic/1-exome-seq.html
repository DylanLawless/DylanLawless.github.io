<p><em><strong>Whole exome sequencing experiment design.</strong> The general
requirements, personnel responsibilities, and cost-breakdown is shown
for a small NGS study of approximately ten participants. If library
preparation and sequencing is performed at a dedicated facility then
scaling up to very large cohorts (&gt;1,000) potential only differs in
one critical feature; implementing the bioinformatic methods used in
this chapter also requires a critical expertise in high-performance
computing. No methods have been included to demonstrate job scheduling
and parallelisation across large computer
clusters.</em></p>

<h1 id="exome-sequencing">Exome sequencing</h1>
<h2 id="sample-preparation">Sample preparation</h2>

<p>For genomic investigations, a patient generally donates a small blood
sample (2-6mL) along with signed consent to use their biological
material and data in genetic and functional research. 
A small sample of hair or saliva are also succificient as a source of DNA if a blood sample is unavailable. 
Ideally, patient DNA is
purified from peripheral blood monocytes. In most cases, the
purification is done using a commercial kit such as that from Qiagen
(51104 QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit). This protocol takes about 1 hour to
purify 1-10 patient samples. Sometimes patient DNA is provided from an
external source such as a local hospital where blood samples are
processed routinely by dedicated staff. In this case, the purification
method may be unknown so extra care should be taken when checking
suitability for sequencing experiments. Consideration should be given to
the possibility of sample mix up, that contamination could have
occurred, etc.</p>

<p>High-throughput sequencing experiments benefit from consistency during
sequencing library preparation. While there are several commercial
options available, the protocol used in this study was the SureSelect XT
target enrichment system for Illumina paired-end multiplexed sequencing
library. A detailed protocol is available from the manufacturer.
However, the process can be summarised in four main steps. After DNA
quality has been checked, the basic protocol consists of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>DNA fragmentation into 100-300 base pair strands, either
    <ul>
      <li>(i) by
using an enzyme that digests the DNA or</li>
      <li>(ii) by breaking by sonication;
the DNA is suspended inside a small glass tube containing a glass rod
which is vibrated by sonic waves inside a water bath.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Another round of quality control checks to ensure that the DNA is
fragmented into the correct size range.</li>
  <li>These fragments are bound by probes that specifically recognise the
coding sequences which collectively make up the exome.</li>
  <li>The DNA that has been selectively purified is then tagged by adding
a tail of nucleotides in specific sequences that label each of the
individual samples with a unique code. When the sequencing step is
performed later, all of the samples will get mixed together. The unique
tag allows us to later re-identify which sequences belong to every
person included in the study.</li>
</ol>

<p>While it is important that library preparation is performed accurately,
the individual steps could be replaced by alternative methods. The
crucial component is an end product of targeted DNA fragments that have
been tagged appropriately to allow the sequencing chemistry on the
chosen system and that fragment lengths are in the correct range. A more
detailed summary of the procedure is outlined;</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of sample</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>DNA is sheared, the most frequently used methods are by enzymatic
digestion and sonication.</li>
  <li>Fragmented DNA is purified using AMPure XP beads.</li>
  <li>Quality assessment.</li>
  <li>End repair.</li>
  <li>Purify using AMPure XP beads.</li>
  <li>Adenylation at 3’ end.</li>
  <li>Purify using AMPure XP beads.</li>
  <li>Paired-end adaptor ligation.</li>
  <li>Purify using AMPure XP beads.</li>
  <li>Amplification.</li>
  <li>Purify using AMPure XP beads.</li>
  <li>Assess quality.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hybridization and capture</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Hybridize capture library probes to DNA.</li>
  <li>Capture the hybridized DNA using streptavidin-coated beads.
Note: at this step, custom gene target libraries can be used.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Indexing and multiplexing</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Captured libraries are amplified with indexing primers.</li>
  <li>Purify using AMPure XP beads.</li>
  <li>Assess quality and concentration of indexed library DNA.</li>
  <li>Pool samples at equal concentrations.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="capture-library">Capture library</h2>
<p>For targeted sequencing experiments, the most important step in library
preparation is the hybridization of capture library probes. Libraries of
probes that are complementary to exome coding sequences can be ordered
from a number of commercial suppliers. For a whole exome, this consists
of hundreds of thousands of short RNA oligonucleotide strands bound to
biotin. When the capture library hybridization mix is added to the DNA,
most of the short probes bind to their complementary DNA sequences over
12-16 hours. To separate these selected fragments from the remaining
bulk of unwanted DNA, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads are added. The
streptavidin attaches to the biotin and therefore the DNA-bound probe
can be pulled out using a strong magnet. Unbound DNA can then be washed
away. Experiments in this study have been performed using Agilent
capture library SureSelect Human All Exon V4-6, although several other
options are available.</p>

<p>Targeted panels can also be used to focus on smaller sets of genes. For
example, in some immunological conditions a panel of  50 genes might be
targeted rather than a library for all known genes (exome). Cancer
genetics screening services sometimes use a small panel of 40-100 genes.
These small panels cut down on cost and focus only on genes where
interpretation of variants would be possible. For the same price as
whole exome, less capture library is needed and more samples can be
sequenced.</p>

<p>As of 2018, all-exon capture library costs roughly £16,000 for enough
reagent to prepare 96 DNA samples. This accounts for about 50% of the
cost of the total library preparation materials. In total, the library
preparation costs about £200 per sample. Once the samples have been
prepared it cost about another £200 to sequence; approximately £400
total.</p>

<h2 id="sequencing">Sequencing</h2>
<p>The sequencing carried out in this study was performed on Illumina
platforms. These include the MiSeq for very small runs of a select set
of genes, HiSeq 3000, 4000, and HiSeq X for whole exome or whole genome
sequencing. The prepared libraries of patient DNA are pooled to contain
5-12 samples per pool. Since each sample has a unique identifier tag, it
is OK to pool them together and later separate out all the individual
data per person. On the HiSeq 3000 approximately 12 samples can be run
per lane with acceptable coverage. This provides about 30-50X reads per
nucleotide, sufficiently deep to confidently identify true germline
mutations. There are 8 lanes per sequencing flow cell. Therefore, a
single sequencing run can contain anything from 50-100 patient samples.
Depending on the sequencing platform the run can take up to 5 days to
complete.</p>

<h2 id="ultra-deep-sequencing">Ultra-deep sequencing</h2>
<p>Mendelian disorders can be successfully explained using exome and whole
genome sequencing. Both the interpretability and cost per sample are
improved in cases where a gene sequencing panel can be used. Some
conditions, particularly autoinflammatory disorders, can arise from low
frequency somatic variants that are capable of driving disease through
potent gain-of-function mechanisms. It is worth noting that a
“gain-of-function” can also be considered as a succinct description for
systems where a loss of inhibitory activity occurs that directly results
in increased signaling cascade activity that would otherwise rest in an
inactive state; a homeostatic pathway. E.g. loss of an autoinhibitory
feature for a single protein or loss of an inhibitory mechanism that is
responsible for direct repression in the absence of stimulation or
specific agonist. In such cases, a low frequency de novo variant will
escape detection with typical sequencing methods, but ultra-deep
sequencing offers a method for detection. This option uses a high
concentration of capture reagent to prepare a highly enriched library
and sequence at high-density on a flow cell to produce ultra-deep
sequencing reads (e.g. &gt;5,000x versus 50x, as typical for whole exome
sequencing). In this case, PCR-free preparation is ideal for somatic
variant detection, naturally.</p>
