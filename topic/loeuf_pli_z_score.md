* constraint Z score [Chen 2022].
 - comparing the observed and expectation variation.
 - shows calculation clearly.

* how LOEUF sore is used [Karczewski 2020]
 - loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction. A conservative estimate of the observed/expected ratio, based on the upper bound of a Poisson-derived confidence interval around the ratio.
 - usage described but method not clear.

* Expected number of variants [Lek 2016]
 - described in the section "Establishing the expected number of variants per gene" but calculation not very clear. Z score also described.
