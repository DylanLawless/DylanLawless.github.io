# A collection of inspiration sources
To build the infrastructure of actionable clinical genomics and precision medicine, I am working on our automated results platforms.
An important requirement is the translation of results to users, such as doctors and patients.
This page hosts some examples of viz inspo that I draw from.
Some pages or links may be dead - this repo is for design reference.

## St. Jude cloud
The St. Jude-Washington University Pediatric Cancer Genome Project became the world's most ambitious effort to discover the origins of childhood cancer and seek new cures. Here are a few pages to see:
* Homepage <https://www.stjude.org/research.html>
* Cloud apps <https://www.stjude.cloud>
* Protein paint <https://pecan.stjude.cloud/proteinpaint/nras>
* Analysis workflows <https://platform.stjude.cloud/workflows>
* Visualisations <https://viz.stjude.cloud/visualizations>

**Figure: Examples from St. Jude cloud. Left:** Analysis workflows each contain a one-page tutorial on running the app and include screenshots, code snippets, data types, etc. It serves as the user documentation. 
**Top right:** Apps include (i) the genomics platform - shown in previous panel - it documents the analysis workflows available on St. Jude. (ii) PeCan - shown in next panel. (iii) Visualisation community app (not shown) tracks the collection of all interactive or published viz such as HiC data, genome browsers, genomepaint splicing, etc.
**Bottom right:** The PeCan app - interactive visualizations of variants and datasets used by all members.
