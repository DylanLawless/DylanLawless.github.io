This table provides links to genetic databases for browsing gene-disease validity evidence.
Genes are only included which match the gene-disease validity curations by ClinGen's Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP).
Some data has been simplified or omitted to produce a responsive reference table.
For extended information including the evidence summary see external links.
