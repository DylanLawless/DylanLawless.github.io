@article{Havrilla220814,
	Abstract = {Deep catalogs of genetic variation collected from many thousands of humans enable the detection of intraspecies constraint by revealing coding regions with a scarcity of variation. While existing techniques summarize constraint for entire genes, single metrics cannot capture the fine-scale variability in constraint within each protein-coding gene. To provide greater resolution, we have created a detailed map of constrained coding regions (CCRs) in the human genome by leveraging coding variation observed among 123,136 humans from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). The most constrained coding regions in our map are enriched for both pathogenic variants in ClinVar and de novo mutations underlying developmental disorders. CCRs also reveal protein domain families under high constraint, suggest unannotated or incomplete protein domains, and facilitate the prioritization of previously unseen variation in studies of disease. Finally, a subset of CCRs with the highest constraint likely exist within genes that cause yet unobserved human phenotypes owing to strong purifying selection.},

@article{Huang:224980,
	Abstract = {In clinical genomics, the continuous evolution of  bioinformatic algorithms and sequencing platforms makes it  beneficial to store patients' complete aligned genomic data  in addition to variant calls relative to a reference  sequence. Due to the large size of human genome sequence  data files (varying from 30 GB to 200 GB depending on  coverage), two major challenges facing genomics  laboratories are the costs of storage and the efficiency of  the initial data processing. In addition, privacy of  genomic data is becoming an increasingly serious concern,  yet no standard data storage solutions exist that enable  compression, encryption, and selective retrieval. Here we  present a privacy-preserving solution named SECRAM  (elective retrieval on Encrypted and Compressed Reference  oriented Alignment Map) for the secure storage of  compressed aligned genomic data. Our solution enables  selective retrieval of encrypted data and improves the  efficiency of downstream analysis (e.g., variant calling).  Compared with BAM, the de facto standard for storing  aligned genomic data, SECRAM uses 18\% less storage.  Compared with CRAM, one of the most compressed nonencrypted  formats (using 34\% less storage than BAM), SECRAM maintains  efficient compression and downstream data processing, while  allowing for unprecedented levels of security in genomic  data storage. Compared with previous work, the  distinguishing features of SECRAM are that (1) it is  position-based instead of read-based, and (2) it allows  random querying of a subregion from a BAM-like file in an  encrypted form. Our method thus offers a space-saving,  privacy-preserving, and effective solution for the storage  of clinical genomic data.},
