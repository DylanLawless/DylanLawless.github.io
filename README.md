# This is the data for my webpage
[DylanLawless.github.io](https://dylanlawless.github.io)

It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

The format of page and blog type structure is built on code from co-creator of GitHub, Tom Preston-Werner.
This site is build from writings in Markdown and LaTex and rendered as a minimalist source of knowledge without annoying popups, ads, or heavy content.

The data is stored on GitHub and a private backup so that content is not lost and can be pushed from many locations.
