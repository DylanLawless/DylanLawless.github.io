<h1 id="tailored-analysis-1">Tailored analysis</h1>
<p>Routine analysis typically takes up to a week, although it is usually
performed on a standardised pipeline that can run automatically on a
high-performance computing platform. A large part of custom filtering
begins when the routine analysis steps have been completed; downstream
analysis is adapted for each particular challenge. The discussion in
explains some foundational steps towards a fully automatic system that
relies only on some input features, such as clinical information. While
many software packages exist that claim to output tailored analysis,
these tend to either only tackle a specific niche or require lots of
curated auxiliary input data.</p>

<p>The output of non-routine analysis (outlined in this chapter) sometimes
takes only five minutes to interpret a cause of disease. In other cases,
data that has been sequenced years previously has not yet relented an
explanation for phenotypes that almost certainly should be explained by
coding variants present within the sequence data. For example, for a
dozen patients who share a similar and severe phenotype, it is often
likely that the same gene or related genes could cause their disease.
Unrelated patients with a rare dominant disease are not to all carry the
same disease-causing variant; they may have different variants in shared
gene, or variants among different genes which all contribute to a shared
pathway that would result in the same end-point phenotype.</p>

<p><strong>Shared pathways in candidate genes.</strong> Output of a STRING database
query for known and predicted protein-protein interactions. These
interactions include physical and functional associations. (STRING is an
SIB-run service of the ELIXIR core data open resources for publicly
funded research).</p>

<p><em>image_caption</em></p>

<p>For example, in <strong>Figure [fig:string_normal_image]</strong> above we see
that from a group of unrelated people, all of the candidate genes
carrying functional variants are joined by their shared functional
interactions. For an autoinflammatory phenotype, genes like <em>NLRP3</em>,
<em>NOD2</em>, <em>TNFAIP3</em>, <em>MyD88</em>, <em>IKBKB</em>, <em>FASLG</em>, or <em>TMEM173</em> might all
have different functions but damaging mutations in any of these could
result in phenotypes that, on the surface, appear related.</p>

<p>Another circumstance might be seen in a small cohort of patients with a
shared autoinflammatory phenotype. For example, the gene <em>NLRP7</em> has
relatively few publications examining it’s role in autoinflammatory
disease. One would not consider this a strong candidate gene if faced
with a variant of unknown significance in this gene from a single
patient. However, three or four very rare or novel mutations in
unrelated patients should be given consideration as producing an
autoinflammatory disease. Single case, or small cohorts lack the power
to measure significant associations. Therefore in the situation proposed
here, manual interpretation is required (biased as it may be).</p>

<p><em>NLRP7</em> variants not reported as producing disease, like <em>MEFV</em>, or
<em>TNFAIP3</em>. However, we must consider that genes plausibly responsible
for causing disease in a dominant manner and that are highly conserved
are generally under purifying selective pressure. Damaging mutations may
be not be compatible with viability and therefore we never see cases of
disease. Variants which are damaging to protein function but that do not
completely destroy all of the normal structure may produce a phenotype
that is pathogenic but viable with modern medical intervention.</p>

<p>In the example of NLRP7, the protein is known to Inhibit
CASP1/caspase-1-dependent IL-1$\beta$ secretion. The functional domains
of this protein are shared in other pro-inflammatory processes. Pyrin,
NACHT, and LRR, domain variants are all studied for autoinflammatory
diseases. The related gene, <em>NLRP3</em>, is probably the most widely
recognised gene where damaging variants in these functional domains
produce severe immune disorders. In cases where we have protein
structures, we can also model the effect.</p>

<p>In our example, <em>NLRP7</em> variants have been reported as the genetic
determinant of a condition that causes early neonatal death and ectopic
pregnancy. Many of the reported variants are stop mutations that will
either produce a truncated protein or prevent expression of the allele
altogether through nonsense-mediated decay. It is difficult predict the
mechanism of disease in cases like this where the two outcomes have
opposing paths. That is to say, a truncated protein may have an active
functional domain which can no longer be inhibited since the C-terminal
domains are missing, while haploinsufficiency would mean that cells
cannot perform their normal function for the pathway since 50% of the
protein is depleted (in heterozygous cases). Haploinsufficiency can
result in a disease that phenotypically resembles a gain-of-function
when the responsible protein normally acts as an inhibitor for an
inflammatory pathway [@Lawless2018acase]. This is not expected with
<em>NLRP7</em> and therefore heterozygous loss-of-function does not explain
disease.</p>

<p>For a candidate gene like this, we have some plausible evidence but
cannot really progress any further without new functional studies. The
first step involved confirmatory Sanger sequencing for all patients
identified through exome sequencing. Next, any close relatives that are
available might be also sequenced for the same variants. If the
mutations are disease-causing then other carriers would also be expected
to have some shared phenotype features. The possibilities in functional
experiments vary widely and are highly dependent on the candidate genes.
The procedure outlined in this hypothetical example is generally
applicable in for the majority of single-case studies and illustrates
the importance of tailored analysis. The initial findings of genomic
analysis may produce more follow up questions, including whether other
probable gene candidates can be ruled out, for which the patient carries
only the “normal” reference alleles (e.g. <em>CFTR</em> screening for cystic
fibrosis/lung disease).</p>
