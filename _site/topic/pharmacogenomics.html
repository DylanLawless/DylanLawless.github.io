<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>With the popularisation of commercial genetics services, more and more people are now able to “decode” their genetic data.
Questions that might arise from this information include “do I have potentially disease-causing variants that can be treated with a drug?”, or “am I taking a drug that will be affected by my genetics?”.
To tackle such questions with an example, we use public data in combination with pharmacogenomics.</p>

<!-- Outside of genotype data (offered by [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com) for example), -->
<p>The most common file type for storing DNA variant data is the VCF format:
<a href="https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531692-VCF-Variant-Call-Format">What is a vcf and how should I interpret it?</a>.</p>

<h2 id="download-vcf-data">Download VCF data</h2>
<p>Example VCF from <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/public_genetic_data">https://my.pgp-hms.org/public_genetic_data</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A randomly selected whole genome VCF file:
    <ul>
      <li>
<a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu24385B">https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu24385B</a>:</li>
      <li>filename: hu24385B 2019-04-07.vcf.gz</li>
      <li>sequence provider: Dante Labs Whole Genome</li>
      <li>size: 147 MB</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Additional examples - not tested:
    <ul>

</li>
      <li>[2] WGS 30x filtered SNP VCF (325 MB) <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu1C1368">https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu1C1368</a>
</li>
      <li>[3] 60820188474283.snp.vcf.gz (222 MB) <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu6ABACE">https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu6ABACE</a>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The “hu24385B” VCF has 3,461,639 variants.
VCF files can contain a large range of information for each variant, however only the first 7 column are strictly neccessary; Chromosome, position, ID, Reference, Alternate, Qulaity, Filter, info. 
<a href="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/1268/what-is-a-vcf-and-how-should-i-interpret-it">The details are explained on this GATK forum post</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vcf_header.png" width="100%"></p>

<p><img src="/images/vcf_body.png" width="100%"></p>

<h2 id="annotate-vcf-data">Annotate VCF data</h2>
<p>Annotation information about the gene name (or related diseases) is often not present when the VCF is generated and only added later.
To get the gene names, the simplest way was is to upload a VCF (or a part of it) to <a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/VEP/">Variant Effect Predictor</a>.
This will supply the gene symbol (and any other information about each DNA variant).</p>

<p>To reduce the time and output you can limit the options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Split the file and run in batches to save time.</li>
  <li>Test the first ~1800 variants:
<br>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head -2000 56001801068861_WGZ.snp.vcf &gt; test.vcf</code>
<br>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>Then annotate with <a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/VEP/">Variant Effect Predictor.</a>
<img src="/images/vcf_vep.png" width="100%"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Make certain that you use the same reference genome as used on the input data.</li>
  <li>The VCF file was made using reference genome GRCh37.</li>
  <li>Therefore, the Ensembl/VEP website URL should be for that genome build (grch37, not the default GRCh38).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="annotating-a-full-vcf">Annotating a full VCF</h2>
<ul>
  <li>One <em>could</em> annotate a whole genome using the Ensembl web interface.</li>
  <li>However, one would need to split your VCF into smaller block first.</li>
  <li>For routine usage the command-line version of VEP and it’s databases should be installed on run locally.</li>
  <li><strong>I will provide a completed annotated VCF for you.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There are several bioinformatics tools that are commonly used for manipulating  genetic file formats such as VCFtools. 
However, to get a real understanding of the data type, here is a method using command line bash to split a VCF file into smaller blocks. 
A bash script is printed below where I use very mainstream traditional command-line tools to wrangle data, including 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gunzip</a>
to unzip compressed files, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wc_(Unix)">wc</a>
to count lines, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)">cat</a>
to print a file, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(Unix)">head</a>
to read the top of a file, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a>
to edit lines, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">awk</a>
for data extraction, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> for text search (not used).</p>

<p>Putting the code below into a file with the filename extension with “.sh” will allow it to be run by your terminal, in this case using the bash language.
I encourage you to read each line and figure out what should happen. If it makes sense then it is reasonable to swap such a manual method with a more efficient specialised tool.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-annotated-genetic-data-to-drug-lists">Comparing annotated genetic data to drug lists</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We now assume that we have a VCF where VEP annotated each variant.</li>
  <li>The features can include gene names, variant consequence, pahtnogenicy prediction, etc.</li>
  <li>The next aim is to see if any output genes are also present in your drug-gene database.</li>
  <li>The method will require merging both dataset (gene and drug datasets) based on shared features.</li>
  <li>A simple sanity test would be useful first.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="drug-gene-list">Drug-gene list</h3>
<p>Here is a drug-gene list “similar” to the private version from DrugBank:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://lawlessgenomics.com/pages/drugbank_all_interaction.txt">notdrugbank_all_interaction.txt</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Drugbank has changed their access policy and now requires access applications. 
If you want the up-to-date DrugBank data I believe you can apply for non-commercial use (and wait a few days). 
The data can then be found at:
<a href="https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest#protein-identifiers">https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest#protein-identifiers</a>, 
“protein-identifiers” tab, “Drug Target Identifiers” section, “All” file.</p>

<h3 id="example-of-how-to-check-gene-list-versus-drug-gene-list">Example of how to check gene list versus drug-gene list</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Extract the gene symbols column from VEP output</li>
  <li>Compare gene symbols to a list of druggable target genes from

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Repeat the same method on the DrugBank dataset</li>

<p>This command also used “uniq -c” to count how many times each gen name occurs and then “grep -v ‘1 ‘” meaning ignore genes that are only present 1 time. 
We want the genes that are present twice, once in each list.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The genes which were in present in both the variant list and DrugBank list are:</li>

<!-- The previos section showed a small example the logic of the process, we can try a more complex real-world example. -->

<p>If you complete this process the output will contain a perfectly merged dataset.
<!-- So in this simple example it takes just 5 minutes to get from a real genome VCF to possibly druggable target genes (see further note on _drug indication_ below). --></p>

<h2 id="downstream-interpretation">Downstream interpretation</h2>
<p>The next challenge lies downstream in interpreting which variants can have an effect that would justify the use of the drug.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are non-coding or synonymous variants worth reporting?</li>
  <li>Genes have multiple transcripts which means one variant can be both coding and non-coding depending on transcript splicing, etc.</li>
  <li>How can we integrate pharmacodynamics, covariates to drug response, contraindications, variant pathogenicity, etc.

<p>My example used <a href="https://www.drugbank.ca">DrugBank</a> for pharmacogenomic information. 
Another option is to use the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-research-drugs/table-pharmacogenomic-biomarkers-drug-labeling">FDA information</a> as the primary source.</p>

<h3 id="is-the-gene-drug-interaction-good-or-bad">Is the gene-drug interaction good or bad?</h3>
<p>Drugs might be either a treatment for a genetic determinant, or a warning for drug usage in someone who also has a genetic variation that might effect their treatment.
The “Labelling Section” listed by FDA might offer the best information.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-research-drugs/table-pharmacogenomic-biomarkers-drug-labeling">https://www.fda.gov/drugs/</a>

<h2 id="understanding-variant-annotation">Understanding variant annotation</h2>
<p><a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/VEP/">Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)</a> is very useful.
During variant annotation, VEP supplies a “consequence” column.
Consequences are general and based on translation of genetic code in humans. 
The Loss-of-function (LoF) consequence is the simplest example (splice, stop mutations).
The variant consequence may be one of the defining criteria by which variants can 
be included in analysis since they are <em>interpretable</em> or of ostensibly <em>known significance</em>.
<em>Note: Using this alone could introduce spurious results so it is  best to have a solid criteria 
for selecting consequences of interest</em>.
The consequences provided by VEP are too long to discuss in detail here.
The table from the ensembl website is worth reading; the HIGH impact variants 
might be a simple method for selecting candidates:
<a href="https://grch37.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/prediction/predicted_data.html#consequences">Ensembl Variation - Calculated variant consequences</a>.<br>
<img src="/images/VEP_consequences.jpg" width="100%"></p>

<p><em>Note: For a real product, the code should be run offline (a perl program with a few local library dependencies). The databases/cache that it uses are a bit too large to include on in a user software. In the real world you would have to send anonymised packets from the user via an API for accessing the genomic databases hosted on your servers. Make sure to check their license to see if you can use oftware and databases in a commercial product</em>.
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/about/legal/code_licence.html">http://www.ensembl.org/info/about/legal/code_licence.html</a></p>

<p>Running the software:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using VEP is a vital part of converting the DNA variant information (genome position and nucleotide change) into annotated variant effects (protein coding change, gene name, predicted pathogenicity).</li>
  <li>It requires the VEP code to run and requires a copy of the database files (reference genome, gene information, etc.).</li>
  <li>You can upload a small number of variants to the online VEP web server to do this, or you can download the database and code to run on your own computer/server.</li>
</ul>

<p>So to process your customer/patient data, you have to choose one of these methods:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Customer must upload their entire file to your server that runs VEP (1GB - 30GB per individual genome data).</li>
  <li>Customer must download the database and VEP code to run on their own computer (complex and large download for them, not recommended).</li>
</ol>

<p>Number 1 is better. But sending one large file often has problems.
If they have a VCF file, you could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Break it into small equal sized blocks to upload the data to you. Anonymisation is normal for all internet connections now, but you could just mention that some method of anonymising these blocks is important since someone “hacker” might try to steal information if most of the network data being sent to you contains small VCF format files.</li>
  <li>You could also run a very small piece of code on the cusotmers software application that could extract just the main parts of the VCF file that you need, instead of sending everything. This is explained in sections 7-9. You could say this, but don’t need to actually have working. i.e. the drugbank information only includes a certain number of human genes so perhaps you could just extract these using a list of genome coordinates before processing with VEP.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the license:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anyone is free to download and use VEP code.</li>
  <li>However, if you modify or reuse the code commercially it might affect the possibility of getting a patent for your product.</li>
  <li>Your product uses VEP as an intermediate step, so you probably only need to include credit, or other legal info to say you have used it.</li>
  <li>If there were a reason to prevent you using the software commercially, you might be able to make a simple replacement that could give the minimum outputs that you need - gene name and mutation type. If the topic happens to interest you, you can read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering#Software">reverse engineering software</a>.</li>
  <li>As an aside, you could also decide that you don’t want to commercialise and offer this tool for free which would prevent bigger companies (like Google) from offering this service in return for harvesting the public’s genetic data.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="optimising-vcf-annotation">Optimising VCF annotation</h3>
<p>The slowest part of the method is VCF annotation.
You can significantly increase the speed by first reducing the input to contain only regions of interst.
That is, prepare a list of coordinates for each gene, and select for those regions in your input VCF or genotype data before annotation (VEP).</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-coordinates-for-a-gene-list">How to get coordinates for a gene list</h3>
<p>Use Biomart.
Their main server was down when I tried, so I went via Ensembl, data access section:<br>
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/index.html">http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/index.html</a><br>
Then to use the BioMart data mining tool<br>

I actually needed the positions using GRCh37 (rather than 38), so I switched to the old Ensembl using<br>
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/tutorials/grch37.html">http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/tutorials/grch37.html</a><br>
to get to <a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/index.html">http://grch37.ensembl.org/index.html</a> 
then the Biomart section<br>

<p>Choose DataBase: Genes 93 Dataset: Human Filter -&gt; Gene -&gt; Input external ref ID list -&gt; (change dropdown) Gene
Name paste your list.
e.g. VPS45 PSMB8 BLNK NEFL NLRP7 SMAD4 PSMB9<br>
To set the output type: Attributes -&gt; Gene -&gt; select “gene start”, “gene stop”, “gene name”, or anything extra.
Select the “Results” button at the top and export.
The results can be tsv or csv.
You would have to figure out how to extract the regions from the vcf (sed, grep, awk, R code, etc.).
When I needed this, I used my own tools which required converting to format like this “X:1-2000”, and ordered by number and alphabetic (some positions in the reference genome were patches added later and have an alphanumeric instead of the normal chromosome).
If you use this list to extract regions from a VCF, remember to include all the original VCF header information.</p>

<h3 id="extracting-regions-from-a-vcf-using-a-bed-file">Extracting regions from a VCF using a bed file</h3>
<p>The early part of this tutorial shows how old-school command line tools can be used to extract data. 
Indeed, this may be computationally most efficient but there are some specialised tools that make the process easier in general.
You can use VCFtools to extract specified regions.<br>
<a href="https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html">https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html</a><br>
You could use a list of defined genome position to reduce the size of your dataset. 
The defined genomic coordinates are generally supplied in a file format called the (BED file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BED_(file_format))
Note that sometimes the bed file “chrom” ID - the name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3) does not match if the VCF file uses “3” instead of “chr3”.
You might need to edit the bed.
My bed file was like this:<br>
(tab spaced), ref.bed<br>
<br>
chrom    chromStart    chromEnd<br>
1    3549    13555<br>
<br>
And this command ran OK for me to give “output_prefix.recode.vcf”<br></p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$:</span>~/tools/vcftools_0.1.13/bin <span class="se">\</span>
./vcftools <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nt">--vcf</span> ~/input.vcf <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nt">--bed</span> ~/ref.bed <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nt">--out</span> output_prefix <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nt">--recode</span> <span class="nt">--keep-INFO-all</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This new VCF will now only contain gene regions that are potentially “druggable”, or at least included on the FDA list.
VCF annotation will be <em>much faster</em> than annotation of the whole genome.</p>

<h2 id="unknown-variants">Unknown variants</h2>
<p>In the majority of situations you will be stuck with <em>variants of unknown significance</em>.
In the absence of tailored analysis and interpretation of each invidual variant, one must often rank unknown variants based on a predicted pathogenicity.
Carefully consider that predictions can be completed wrong and address how such an annotation should be presented. 
One can rank unknown variants based on PHRED-scaled CADD score, highest being more predicted pathogenic.
https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/info<br>
<a href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/">Polyphen</a> gives a predicted outcome label and a probability score 0-1 from benign to probably damaging.
See what other pathogenicity prediction tools you can find and estimate how widespread/accepted their usage is.</p>

<h2 id="gene-dosage">Gene dosage</h2>
<p>An important cosideration of variant effect depends on gene dosage.
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)">dominant gene</a> may be affected by a single heterozgous variant while a recessive gene may be able to compensate against the negative effect of a heterozyous variant due the presence of a second functional gene copy.
Therefore, the presence of heterozygous or homozygous allele is an important consideration.
Some genes may be sensitive to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity">hemizygous</a> effect, low frequency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_(biology)">somatic variants</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(genetics)">mosaisism</a>, etc.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNV_calling_from_NGS_data">SNV calling in NGS</a> is a broad topic, but it is safe to say that at least the allele dosage (generally heterozygous or homozygous) should be included in result summary.
If possible, when a gene is linked to a specific disease then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity">inheritance type</a> associated with that gene-disease should also be included. 
For example, <a href="https://www.omim.org">https://www.omim.org</a> is a good place to see examles.
The genetic disease <a href="https://www.omim.org/entry/219700?search=cystic%20fibrosis&highlight=cystic%20fibrosi">cystic fibrosis</a> is shown with an inheritance type AR (autosomal recessive) meaning that damaging variants on both gene alleles are required to cause disease. 
The gene <em>cftr</em>, which is the genetic determinant of cystic fibrosis, also has an <a href="https://www.omim.org/entry/602421?search=cftr&highlight=cftr">OMIM page <em>cftr</em></a> that also lists AR inheritance.
An excellent resource for matching gene to disease is the <a href="https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk">https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk</a>.
Individual genes can be explored, or “panels” of disease-specific gene lists can be explored. For example, here is the “<a href="https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/panels/545/">Bleeding and platelet disorders</a>” panel. 
This shows the “Mode of inheritance” and colour-coded confidence in the disease-gene relationship.
Integrating this type of expert-curated open datasets can be extremely useful.</p>

<h2 id="drug-indication-1">Drug indication</h2>
<p>The indication or warning can be difficult to automate.
For the example drug<br>
<a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB11595">https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB11595</a><br>
the section “Pharmacology” “Indication” has the Indication info.<br>
The FDA label is contained as a PDF attachment in the section “REFERENCES” FDA label Download (245 KB).
If I had to automate the process I would add a URL link for each drug:<br>
for gene name CD274<br>
the drugbank column Drug IDs has these:<br>
DB11595; DB11714; DB11945<br>
and for each ID you could append the ID onto the drugbank URL to link to the webpage
<a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/">https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/</a>.
You can do this in R with some technical how-to reading, or do it manually for a quick example like this and removing space to create a web URL.<br>
URL				Drug IDs<br>
https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/	DB00303<br>
https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/	DB00114<br>
https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/	DB00142<br>
https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/	DB01839<br>
https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/	DB00125</p>

<h2 id="a-large-scale-example-summary">A large scale example summary</h2>
<p>I do not suggest this for a small project, but if I was to automate subsection requests for real:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[1] Download the whole database (probably a big table sized &gt;100MB) and</li>
  <li>[2] For every query (the Drug ID) extract the sections of interest (indication,  Biologic Classification, Description,  FDA label, etc.)</li>
  <li>[3] Display each section as additional columns in candidate genes table.<br>
<br>
</li>
  <li>[1] Would be here: <a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/latest">https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/latest</a>
</li>
  <li>[2] Would be like this: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp</a><br>
Look at example 2, your database request might be something like:
[get food name = Belgian Waffles, description] or
[get drug ID = DB11595, indication,  Biologic Classification, Description,  FDA label.]
The database request problem can be tricky to optimise but not especially difficult with some experience in SQL-type management.</li>
  <li>[3] For every line in the gene candidate table, do this query request and output the result into the same row.<br>
The final table would be something that includes colunm headers like:<br>
Gene, consequence, variant, amino acid, genome position, CADD, DrugBank ID, Description, Indication, FDA label PDF link, etc.
This table could be ranked based on consequence, CADD score.

<p>University-based start-ups ususally follow a plan with three or four funding stages before coming to market. 
It is also possible to get investors from day 1, but it is more usual to follow 
the steps outlined here.

<!-- ## DNA regulation and the 3D genome -->
<!-- There is a collection of reviews on [the 3D genome Nature Reviews 2019](https://www.nature.com/collections/rsxlmsyslk). -->
<!-- From this, I have collected some illustrations to remind us about the combination of biochemical and physical structure that DNA takes inside each cell. -->

<!-- ### 3D genome variation -->
<!-- DNA is not only a simple string of nucleotides. -->
<!-- It is constantly wrapped up around proteins which affect its shape and accessibility. -->
<!-- This means that genes encoded on the DNA may take different lengths of time to be expressed and produce proteins. -->
<!-- Some DNA regions may physically cluster together and are labelled as topologically associating domains (TADs). -->
<!-- <!-1- <a class="citation" href="#spielmann2018structural">(Spielmann et al., 2018)</a> -1-> -->

<!-- > _Box 1 Chromatin organization  from the 3D nucleus to the linear genome._ -->

<!-- In coding regions, a "damaging" DNA variant will affect the function of a protein, or cause complete loss of that protein. -->
<!-- In some cases, a single gene defect can cause a specific disease. -->
<!-- Similarly, changing the expression of DNA (even if the gene has no damaging coding variants) could cause the same outcome. -->
<!-- Therefore, regions of DNA that control the expression of surrounding genes are just as important as coding variants. -->
<!-- Historically, effects due to DNA accessibility and expression have been very difficult to understand biologically, but the methods and evidence is improving. -->

<!-- ### Noncoding DNA regulation -->
<!-- It is useful to understand the mechanisms causing DNA regulation more specifically. -->
<!-- If you want a good understanding of the topic, one of the best resources today is the -->
<!-- The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project -->
<!-- <!-1- <a class="citation" href="#gtex2020gtex">(Consortium, 2020)</a> -1-> -->
<!-- [https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz1776](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz1776). -->
<!-- GTEx include WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq data. -->
<!-- This paper has an excellent overview, and their web interface is informative -->
<!-- [https://www.gtexportal.org/home/](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/). -->

<!-- One of the most common uses of GTEx is as follows: -->

<!-- * When an association between genetic variant and a phenotype is found (e.g. a common DNA variant and heart disease), it is often not due to a coding variant but instead due to a non-coding variant. -->
<!-- * To understand how this can cause disease, we match DNA and RNA from the same individuals to see how this variant affects the expression level of downstream genes. -->
<!-- * If the DNA variant is correlated with a change in RNA expression (and subsequently protein level) we can determine its regulatory effect. -->
<!-- * We quantify the RNA expression and its affect on trait (phenotype) within this DNA loci (gene or group of genes): expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). -->
<!-- * There are other types of QTL, but eQTL are a fine example. -->

<!-- The following two figures from -->
<!-- <!-1- <a class="citation" href="#elkon2017characterization">(Elkon &amp; Agami, 2017)</a> -1-> -->
<!-- [https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3863](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3863) -->
<!-- can help to visualise an example of the process. -->

<!-- * In the second figure (labelled Figure 4b) we consider one gene with a certain nucleotide position, having either G or A (2 chromosomes gives possibilites of GG, GA, or AA). -->
<!-- * We can see how one genotype may have lower RNA expression (and less protein produced) for people with two copies of the gene with nucleotide G. -->
<!-- * However, people with one or two copies of this gene with an A nucleotide at the same position may have higher RNA expression levels (and more protein). -->
<!-- * If this gene is used in drug metabolism, then perhaps they should receive a personalised drug dosage. -->

<!-- > _Figure 1: Genome-wide identification of candidate regulatory regions. (a) The conditions in which each gene is expressed are determined by a complex interplay between cis-regulatory DNA elements embedded near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) (the gene's promoter region, typically taken as 1,000 bp upstream to 200 bp downstream of the TSS) and distal enhancer elements located far (along the linear genomic DNA) from the gene's TSS. These DNA elements are bound by TFs that modulated the efficiency by which RNA polymerase is recruited to the gene's TSS to initiate transcription. Image adapted with permission from Figure 1, ref. 21, Springer Nature. (b) Distinct chromatin marks correlate with different regulatory states. Thus, epigenomic profiling of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and TF binding in large panels of cell lines and tissues predicts comprehensive maps of putative regulatory elements across the genome and indicates the conditions under which each element is active. Reprinted from Figure 2, ref. 157, Mol. Cell., 55, Plank, J.L. & Dean, A., Enhancer function: mechanistic and genome-wide insights come together. 5–14 (2014), with permission from Elsevier. (c) Bidirectional production of eRNAs emerges as an effective mark of active enhancers. Thus, expression profiling of eRNAs is used on top of the epigenomic layers to improve the identification of enhancers and delineate the conditions in which they are activated. This cartoon shows tracks for epigenetic hallmarks of enhancers (DHS, histone marks and TF binding sites (TF BS) in addition to bidirectional production of eRNAs (as detected by GRO-seq))._ -->

<!-- > _Figure 4: Inference of enhancer-promoter links. (a) Enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions are predicted based on their correlated activation pattern measured over a large panel of cells and tissues. Activation pattern could be measured by epigenetic marks, DHS or transcriptional activity (e.g., mRNA and eRNA levels). (b) Top: eQTL analysis detects associations between SNP genotypes and expression level of target genes. In this example, individuals who are homozygous for the reference allele (GG) show significantly lower expression of the target gene than individuals who are homozygous for the alternative allele (AA). Heterozygous individuals show an intermediate expression level. If either the eQTL SNP itself or any other SNP that is in strong linkage disequilibrium with it is located within a regulatory element, then a putative functional link between that enhancer and the promoter of the associated gene is predicted. Bottom: allele-specific expression analysis requires the presence of a heterozygous SNP within the target RNA (in the figure, the SNP with the T/C alleles), and tests for imbalanced expression from the two copies (maternal and paternal copies) of the gene. Imbalanced expression of the two copies implies that the individual is also heterozygous for another SNP that modulates the activity of a cis-regulatory element that controls the expression of the target gene. The A allele of the SNP located within the enhancer increases the enhancer activity and thus causes elevated expression of the copy of the gene encoded on the same chromosome (the copy of the gene that carries the C allele)._ -->

<!-- ### Chromatin regulation and mutation -->
<!-- Briefly, we might also consider how to improve our methods over time. -->
<!-- The 3D genome structure also affects how likely mutation is to occur due to the probability of physical biochemical events occurring. -->
<!-- Very simply, "random" mutations occur frequently in DNA. They are either "repaired" or passed on and subject to natural selection. -->

<!-- * Consider the variable frequency of variants across the genome throughout the human population. -->
<!-- * Also consider that progression towards old age can lead to an increase in such random mutation within a single person (leaving out many citations here). -->

<!-- ## PCA and LD -->
<!-- The following paper is relatively old now. -->
<!-- However, it illustrates population structure nicely. -->
<!-- As parent pass one their DNA down to children, rearrangements occur. -->
<!-- However, the DNA rearrangements occur as relatively large stretches of DNA. -->
<!-- Therefore, within a related population most people will have very similar blocks of DNA (including common variants) and only small numbers of novel (rare) variants. -->

<!-- 1. Common variants might be most useful for pharmacogenomics in general since so many people share the same sets of variants / affected gene-drug interactions. -->
<!-- 2. Each individual rare variant only affect a minority. However, they might be rare because they may cause an unusual phenotype which is not as likely to survive natural selection. This unique gene-phenotype might lead to a new discovery in biological mechanism. -->
<!-- 3. If we share large stretches of DNA in a population, having one common variant means that you are likely to also have the second common variant on the same stretch of DNA. The nature of DNA [linkage disequilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium) (LD) allows us to make statistical inferences that are very powerful for genetic analysis. For example, only sequencing a small number of SNPs across the genome which represent each DNA LD block allows us define genetic ancestry (23andMe, forensic genetics, GWAS, etc). -->

<!-- [https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07331](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07331) illustrates how analysis DNA in this way, using principal component analysis (PCA), shows that geographic location and genetic ancestry strongly overlap. -->
<!-- It also illustrates how tailored medical treatments would generally apply to different people based on their genetic ancestry. -->
<!-- Very few people are likely to require a treatment that is unique only to them. -->
<!-- Although treatment with a combination of drugs and different gene-drug interactions will increase the level of unique tailoring. -->

<!-- ## More questions -->

<!-- Q: Do we have to infer that in the future everybody will have his genome sequenced ? -->
<!-- You do not have to assume this. It may become true. There could be privacy concerns or social problems arising from genetic prejudice, etc. -->

<!-- Q: Before using our algorithm, patient will have to sequence a part of their genome and thus this is a weakness of our algorithm? -->
<!-- Your tool will provide a service based on genetics. -->
<!-- Option [1] One has their genetics already and will use it for personal medicine. -->
<!-- Option [2] they are prescribed a drug and want to only sequence the genes of interest that could affect this drug. -->
<!-- Option [3] they do not want any genetic info and therefor your product is irrelevant. -->
<!-- Option [4] they do not want their personal genetics, but are willing to estimate their relatedness to others in a genetic database and therefore calculate a probability of accuracy for this drug-gene information. e.g. both parents are Swiss and therefore based on the population they have probability of X that their genotype is Y. -->

<!-- Q: Is it realistic to assume that it will be feasible based on the fact that the sequencing cost is decreasing ? -->
<!-- Irrelevant in this case, but yes, whole genome seq is sometimes below 200CHF will likely be common soon. -->

<!-- Q:  We plan to use polyphen and/or sift in order to discriminate between those types of variants. Is that a good idea? -->
<!-- That is a good start. CADD score is also pretty well known among physicians. -->
<!-- In my opinion, I do not trust the scores often. -->
<!-- However, it is common that for processing a large amount of data, such prediction tools are useful in general. -->
<!-- For example, I might [1] rank first on VEP variant "consequences"; stop mutations with most importance. -->
<!-- [2] Then rank secondly with these values since you cannot interpret most with consequence = missense variant. -->
