# This is the data for LawlessGenomics
[lawlessgenomics.com](https://lawlessgenomics.com) hosted via [DylanLawless.github.io](https://dylanlawless.github.io)

It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.
For testing, jekyll serve runs this site locally for testing before pushing (jek.sh). 
The format of page and blog type structure is built on code from co-creator of GitHub, Tom Preston-Werner.
This site is built from writings in Markdown and LaTex and rendered as a minimalist source of knowledge without annoying popups, ads, or heavy content.

The data is stored on GitHub and a private backup so that content is not lost and can be pushed from many locations.
