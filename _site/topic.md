Heritability is proportion of variance of a trait due to genetics (non-environmental, non-stochastic).

Simple, Additive model - each allele/genotype acts independently. No gene interactions are account for. Gene dosage is measured; a homozygous variant would account for _double the effect_ of a heterozygous variant. 

h^2 _narrow sense heritability_  proportion of variance for a trait due to additive genetic factors
H^2 _broad sense heritability_ proportion of variance for a trait due to greater genetic factors including dominance and gene-gene interactions.

Shared genetic ancestry frequently has shared environment, making it difficult to separate.
