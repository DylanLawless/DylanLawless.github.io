Forgive this self-praise, but I am very happy that our recent paper 
_Germline TET2 loss of function causes childhood immunodeficiency and lymphoma_
{% cite stremenova2020germline %} has been 
credited for a newly added immune gene in _Novel inborn errors of immunity: an Interim Update by the IUIS Committee_
[full link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-021-00980-1),
[pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10875-021-00980-1.pdf),
as [TET2 in table 1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10875-021-00980-1/tables/1)
{% cite tangye2021ever %}.
It has been included for the gene list of _Autoinflammatory diseases_ based on our work in 3 patients, 2 families with autosomal recessive loss-of-function.
Since I began research on the genomics of immunology, the IUIS list of genes has been an extremely important reference for my work to which I am now thrilled to _give back_.

International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) [IUIS.org](https://iuis.org);
&gt;The International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) is an umbrella organization for many of the regional and national societies of immunology throughout the world. As articulated in its Constitution, the objectives of IUIS are:
&gt; * to organize international co-operation in immunology and to promote communication between the various branches of immunology and allied subjects
&gt; * to encourage within each scientifically independent territory co-operation between the Societies that represent the interests of immunology
&gt; * to contribute to the advancement of immunology in all its aspects.

From _Novel inborn errors of immunity: an Interim Update by the IUIS Committee_,
&gt; Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are generally considered to result from monogenic germline defects that manifest as increased susceptibility to severe and/or recurrent infectious diseases, autoimmune or autoinflammatory conditions, atopic manifestations, and hematopoietic or solid tissue malignancies [[1](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abb1662)]. 
&gt; Over the past decade, the discovery of new IEIs has been occurring at an impressive rate. 
&gt; Indeed, the 2011 biennial update published by the IUIS Committee update listed 191 IEIs; this number increased to 430 in the 2019 update
&gt; [[2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-020-00758-x)],
&gt; [[3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-019-00737-x)].
&gt; This near-exponential increase in gene discovery is being driven by the accessibility and affordability of next-generation sequencing, and the efficient application of these technologies to elucidate the molecular etiology of unsolved cases of IEIs that are likely to result from single-gene defects
&gt; [4](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2016.08.003).
&gt;
&gt; Over the last 12 months, we have witnessed the ongoing rapid identification, and occasionally detailed molecular, biochemical, and cellular characterization, of genetic variants that cause, or are at least associated with, human diseases impacting host defense or immune regulation.
&gt; Here, we will summarize reports on variants detected in 26 genes which we consider represent novel IEI 
&gt; ([Table 1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10875-021-00980-1/tables/1)).
&gt; Many additional genetic variants have been reported recently. 
&gt; However, those listed here have been adjudicated by the IUIS Committee to meet the strict criteria to be considered disease-causing
&gt; [57](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20140520).

Our paper took several years to complete, 
although the genomic analysis worked incredibly well in this case - 
a patient presented as described in **figure 1** (Fig. S3 in publication);
after running the routine pipeline that we had made, the result was immediately the top candidate, number one, as cause of disease in a single patient, lymphoma with immunodeficiency and autoinflammtory disease
{% cite stremenova2020germline %}.
We then found that our collaborator had a second family with a LoF in the same gene causing the same severe immunological features.
By combining the families for further genomic and functional analysis work over several years we finally produced a robust explanation for the disease and strong evidence of the immunological features.
The summarised information can be read in 
[Table 1 Newly validated inborn errors of immunity](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10875-021-00980-1/tables/1).

The gene of interest, _TET2_ is intriguing since it is the monogenic cause of disease but has a widespread mechanism of action throughout the genome by epigenetic effects.
From one of my unpublished documents, in reference to different types of epigenetic systems;
&gt; The effect of mutations which disrupt any of these systems have been described as damaging toward (i) epigenetic modifiers, (ii) epigenetic mediators, and (iii) epigenetic modulators [[15](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26972587/)]. Epigenetic modifiers are genes whose products have direct involvement; protein coding genes that control DNA methylation, post-translational modification, or higher-order chromatin structure (e.g. TET2, IDH, ARID). Mutation in these genes can have a cascade effect since they control the regulation of many downstream genes. The downstream genes which are targeted by the modifiers are epigenetic mediators.
&gt; Damaging mutations in mediators might only be linked with epigenetics when they occur in, for example, tumour suppressor genes resulting in the same disease as mutation in one of the upstream epigenetic modifiers. Epigenetic modulators are upstream of modifiers and have the potential to induce or suppress differentiation-specific epigenetic states. Pro-inflammatory NF-ÎºB signalling has been reported as an example of a modulator that links the environment and epigenome [[15](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26972587/)]. Excessive signalling in this pathway can trigger an epigenetically-dependant interleukin-6 positive feed-back loop.

&lt;div class=&quot;table-wrapper&quot; markdown=&quot;block&quot;&gt;

| Epigenetic modulators | Epigenetic modifiers | Epigenetic mediators |
|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Secondary effect on multiple pathways (NF-kB, IL-6) | Primary effect on multiple genes (TET2, IDH1) | Primary effect on single genes (IGF-2, OCT4, WNT) |

&lt;/div&gt;

When a protein has widespread control for many other genes, a LoF variant is often embryonic lethal and would never result in a relatively narrow phenotype. 
For TET2 LoF, we found that completely disrupting the genome-wide methylation process causes a pronounced immunological phenotype.
Unfortunately, the disease can be very difficult to correct without successful haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
In such cases, a great deal of biological understanding is gained that may otherwise have taken very long to elucidate. 

Loss of TET2 in humans has severe consequences including haematological malignancy.
Yet, it has also been shown that TET2 knock-out can improve anti-tumour therapy for the same reasons;
Fraietta et al. showed that while developing therapeutic CD19-targeted T cells (CAR-T anti-tumour therapy), the integration of the CD19-CAR sequence happened to interrupt the TET2 coding sequence by chance
{% cite fraietta2018disruption %}.
This fortuitous integration event had a combined effect; disrupting TET2 promoted the therapeutic efficacy of CD19-targeted T cells in the patient. 
Inhibiting TET2 normally would not be considered ameliorative in cancer immunology. 
However, in this case the pathogenic effect of TET2 deficiency allowed for more successful CAR-T cell therapy. 
It is likely that this type of combined genetic alteration will improve CART function. This anecdotal example demonstrates the lymphoproliferative effect of TET2 deficiency.

## Introduction
A colleague asked me about why there are multiple mRNA transcripts with different variant positions from a single variant in human genomic DNA.
Here is a short summary to answer that question (forgiving over-simiplifications).
First, a quick recap of how DNA is used to protuce proteins.
Then an example of a gene where the mRNA could be spliced more than one way by the splisosome complex.

## DNA to protein
1. Genomic DNA (only one version per cell/individual).
2. Transcription to pre-mRNA (one exact copy of DNA as mRNA).
3. Splicing pre-mRNA to mRNA transcript (introns removed by splisosome). One version or several slightly different versions. 
4. Spliced mRNA (messenger mRNA) translated into amino acid peptide chain.
5. Peptide chain folds into protein.

Genomic DNA is transcripted over and over, in every cell (ignoring tissue-speicif expression, dynamics, etc.).
When the pre-mRNA is spliced, there may be multiple versions produced.
It all depends on how the splicing complex recognizes the intron/exon sequences. 
This also explains why _splice mutations_ occur in 4-5 the nucleotides around the junction between exon and intron. 
The is the part of the sequence that is recognised by the splisosome.

## Mutation example
A DNA mutation at position g.73,878,863 A&gt;T

This mutation will only affect transcript [2] at
cDNA (mRNA) position c.2A&gt;T
and protein position p.Met1Leu.

Transcript [1] is not affected because the coding sequence begins later in the DNA sequence. 

## cDNA note
The cDNA position notation is used for simplicity. 
We assume the parts of genomic DNA that will remain after splicing (introns and upstream/downstream sequences removed), and call this the coding DNA (cDNA).
We can physically create cDNA when we collect mRNA from a cell and do reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to make a DNA copy.

# Variants of concern aligned to vaccine coding sequences

This work has not been peer reviewed.

[Open PDF visualisation - variants_of_concern_to_vaccine.pdf](https://github.com/DylanLawless/variants_of_concern_to_vaccine_SARS-CoV2/blob/master/variants_of_concern_to_vaccine.pdf)

## Aims and results
* To produce standardized alignments of vaccine sequences.
* Determine which are at risk to emerging variants.

From the data presented within:

1. The translated amino acid sequences for all vaccines were derived.
2. These were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference amino acid sequences of spike glycoprotein.
3. Known variants-of-concern were then annotated and visualised.

## Overview
Variants-of-concern for five SARS-CoV-2 strains 
([CDC 4 Jun 2021](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fvariant-surveillance%2Fvariant-info.html))
are illustrated against the 
translated amino acid sequences of the vaccines; 

* Moderna mRNA-1273
* Pfizer/BioNTech BNT-162b2
* Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson Ad26.COV2-S
* Novavax NVX-CoV2373
* Curevac CVnCoV
* Sputnik V
* AstraZeneca AZD1222

and reference genome sequences;

* QHD43416.1 [MN908947.3] and
* YP\_009724390.1 [NC\_045512.2].

The variants-of-concern are shown here, illustrated on the protein structure;

Both reference sequences are provided in files:

- [reference\_sequence\_NC\_045512.2.21563-25384.md](https://github.com/DylanLawless/variants_of_concern_to_vaccine_SARS-CoV2/tree/master/sarscov2_reference_sequence/reference_sequence_NC_045512.2.21563-25384.md)

## Vaccine sequence reproduction
The sequences for vaccines have been reproduced by careful reconstruction based on 

1. The authors&apos; reported reference sequence and 
2. The description of the genetic modifications used during vaccine development. 

The primary sources are provided in each case, along with a detailed description of the genetic variants provided by authors.
Additionally, the correct [HGVS-recommended nomenclature](https://varnomen.hgvs.org/recommendations) has been used for more reliable reproduction than some of the primary sources.

**For visual simplicity, an X symbol was used to illustrate amino acid deletions**.
All other amino acid changes use their correct symbol.

For vaccines BNT-162b2 and mRNA-1273, the assemblies have also been sourced from [NAalytics](https://github.com/NAalytics/Assemblies-of-putative-SARS-CoV2-spike-encoding-mRNA-sequences-for-vaccines-BNT-162b2-and-mRNA-1273).
This data matches the vaccine sequences that have been reproduced here based on primary literature.
Briefly, 
their experimental sequence information from the initial 
Moderna ([Corbett Nature 2020 Oct](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32756549/))
and Pfizer/BioNTech ([Polack NEJM 2020 Dec](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33301246/))
COVID-19 vaccines, allowed them to produce a working assembly of the former 
and a confirmation of previously reported sequence information for the latter RNA.
Their data was sourced and formatted to select the coding sequences.
The nucleotide sequences were then translated into amino acid coding sequences
using &lt;https://web.expasy.org/translate/&gt;,
as shown in files:

## Vaccine Multiple Sequence Alignment
The amino acid sequences of the coding region from each of the vaccine sequences 
and the reference sequence were used for multiple sequence alignment
via &lt;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/&gt;.

Variants-of-concern were then formatted to be used for annotation on the 
aligned sequences.

## Variants of concern
SARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions were derived from 
&lt;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fvariant-surveillance%2Fvariant-info.html&gt;

This dataset includes:

* Variants of Interest (VOI)
* Variants of Concern (VOC)
* Variants of High Consequence (VOHC)

The reformatted tables are presented in files:

- [variants\_of\_concern.xlsx](https://github.com/DylanLawless/variants_of_concern_to_vaccine_SARS-CoV2/blob/master/variants_of_concern.xlsx)
- [variants\_of\_concern.csv](https://github.com/DylanLawless/variants_of_concern_to_vaccine_SARS-CoV2/blob/master/variants_of_concern.csv)

There are currently no VOHC. 
VOC (but not VOI) were presented in the final visualisation.

## Aligned variants-of-concern to vaccine

The variants of concern were formatted such that one pseudo-fasta format entry 
contains the amino acid change for each strain. 
This data was then added to the multiple sequence alignment file to allow for
aligned annotations,
as shown in file:

[variants\_of\_concern\_to\_vaccine.fa](https://github.com/DylanLawless/variants_of_concern_to_vaccine_SARS-CoV2/blob/master/variants_of_concern_to_vaccine.fa)

The file contains the list the variants-of-concern for five Sars-CoV-2 strains,
2 reference sequence, and
6 vaccine sequences:

* Variants of Concern B.1.1.7
* Variants of Concern B.1.351
* Variants of Concern B.1.427
* Variants of Concern B.1.429
* Variants of Concern P.1
* Ref QHD43416.1 [MN908947.3]
* Ref YP\_009724390.1 [NC\_045512.2]
* mRNA-1273 vaccine translated
* BNT-162b2 vaccine translated
* Ad26.COV2-S vaccine translated
* NVX-CoV2373 vaccine translated
* Sputnik V alleged unmodified YP_009724390.1
* AZD1222 alleged unmodified YP_009724390.1

&lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/posts/coronavirus-cutaway-600.png %}&quot; width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;

Different strains will contain benign variants.
Typically, full sequences are used for alignment. 
However, this can be visually distracting.
Instead, only the variants-of-concern are annotated for the strain sequences. 

The final illustration was made using &lt;https://www.snapgene.com&gt; software.
The snapgene-software formatted output can be loaded with the file:

[variants\_of\_concern\_to\_vaccine.praln](https://github.com/DylanLawless/variants_of_concern_to_vaccine_SARS-CoV2/blob/master/variants_of_concern_to_vaccine.praln)

# Itan &amp; Casanova contributions

We are tackling this problem of protein pathway analysis from the viewpoint of 
rare immune disease and infection.
Historically, several topics in bioinformatic and functional analysis have 
been required before we could achieve our current position of 
statistically-robust genetic discovery for rare disease:

1. Candidate variant select for individual genomes
2. Compiling reliable cohorts of patients with shared phenotypes
3. Protein-protein interactions
4. Variant collapse
5. Protein pathway analysis
6. Functional validation

Therefore, a historical review of the timeline is beneficial to illustrate the 
technical successes that allow us to reliably produce candidate variants by
genome sequencing and to validate statistically-driven results by _&quot;traditional&quot;_
functional validation. 
These steps [1, 2 and 6 in our list] are exemplified by the following 
historical review. 
The complete list of steps 1-6 are touched on, 
but full validation of each step is the culmination of what we are currently 
working on and will be explicitly reviewed when we have completed our study.

As one of the leaders in this field, Casanova lab has provided a lot of insider
history to the story in a great twitter thread
&lt;https://twitter.com/casanova_lab/status/1397539593608695808&gt;.

To date, the main paper that implements protein pathway analysis for rare 
immune disease is that by
Peng Zhang and 
Yuval Itan {% cite zhang2021computational %}.

The history begins with determining methods for candidate variant selection - 
the main challenge in human genomics, 
especially for individual patients who can benefit from precision medicine. 
Over the last decade, we have reached a point where we can now reasonably 
discern individual candidate-causal variants from the background noise of 
genomic variability.

From the authors&apos; perspective, the project began around 2011 and its first 
step was concluded in 2013 with 
Yuval Itan&apos;s
first &quot;Human Gene Connectome&quot; paper 
while he was a post-doc with Casanova lab. 
{% cite itan2013human %}.
This software connected genes like streets in a map, 
based on their physiological relatedness.
It was soon followed by methodological development 
{% cite itan2014hgcs %}
and application to inborn errors of immunity 
{% cite itan2015novel %}
or both 
{% cite itan2015human %},
and a couple of necessary detours 
{% cite itan2016mutation %}
and 
{% cite maffucci2019blacklisting %}.
A review was also written by two of the main authors during the same period
{% cite itan2015can %}.

When Peng Zhang joined the Casanova lab as post-doc, 
Yuval Itan had started his own lab. 
However, the pair worked together to continue producing the papers on variant
interpretation and data processing
{% cite zhang2018popviz %}
and
{% cite zhang2019seqtailor %}.

After completing this period of work, 
they renamed &quot;Human Gene Connectome II&quot; the 
&quot;Network-based Heterogeneity Clustering&quot;.
At this point, their aims were defined as being generally indistinguishable 
from ours. 
That is, _&quot;the detection of physiological homogeneity in a cohort of patients 
sharing a clinical phenotype but with high genetic heterogeneity - 
a hallmark of severe infectious diseases&quot;_ (Casanova via twitter), 
as presented in their next paper on this topic
{% cite casanova2020human %}.

Shen-Ying Zhang came on board as senior author on the next two papers.
With an excellent database of immune disorders and infections, 
the team could gradually build their software.
Exomes from patients with HSV-1 encephalitis were used for testing successive 
versions in
{% cite bastard2021herpes %} 
and 
{% cite gao2021tlr3 %}.

Quoting Casanova _&quot;When they were capable of detecting the known TLR3-IFN needles in the HSE stack, they installed camp 1, rested a bit and reported to me on the radio, while I was watching them from the basecamp with binoculars. I encouraged them to push for the final ascent and they did.&quot;_

With the same goal as our own - 
producing unbiased methods for detection of biologically-connected causal 
genetic variation - 
they found new gene variants that interact via the TLR3-IFN protein pathway,
in individual patients. 
Shen-Ying Zhang found them to be biochemically deleterious, 
an important factor for validation of genetic-first aproaches. 
In this case, Zhang _et al_ get as close to the _&quot;gold-standard&quot;_ 
as anyone to date.

The functional validation of candidate variants in disease then provided a proof-of-principle indication that they could detect physiological homogeneity in the midst of genetic heterogeneity 
{% cite zhang2021computational %}.

Quoting Casanova 
_&quot;A computational approach for detecting physiological homogeneity in the midst of genetic heterogeity.
That was terrific!&quot;_.

---

&gt; An aside on what I call the _&quot;gold-standard&quot;_ for our field should be:
&gt; 1. Unbiased statistical detection of a genetic phenomenon.
&gt; 2. Validation by functional models under systematic control.
&gt; 
&gt; Part [1] Depends on patient cohorts that are large enough to detect the effect based on the phenotype strength - difficult for _rare disease_.\
&gt; Part [2] Depends on independently testing biological mechanisms. 
&gt;
&gt; This second step generally consists of two hurdles:
&gt; * If the same researchers perform (1) genetic stats and (2) functional work, 
&gt; there is a bias that is difficult to avoid when trying to functionally 
&gt; validate statistically positive results.
&gt; * If the statistical genetic associations happen to contain a false positive 
&gt; for something like severe rare immune disease, 
&gt; the sensitive functional models may detect a damaging response. 
&gt; One might find a truly damaging biological mechanism, 
&gt; but if the statistical genetic association is not correct then this 
&gt; biological mechanism should not be deemed causal; 
&gt; back-tracking at this stage would be very difficult due to self-imposed bias. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ideally, in the future we hope to see a separation of the two steps 
&gt; (stat genetics and wet-lab) such that each are performed independently. 
&gt; The wet-lab would also ideally focus their routines on a particular protein 
&gt; pathway/system with SOPs that improve accuracy and precision 
&gt; (e.g. clinical diagnostics labs, clinical trials) rather than setting up 
&gt; models for each new study.

---

Returning to our historical review, 
we have been producing our protocols similarly in parallel.
With patient cohorts of comparable sizes and phenotypes we will soon 
have a complementary validation of protocols.
However, great care is also being taken to test and select the most reliable 
statistical methods for association testing - 
an improvement to the fine work by
{% cite zhang2021computational %}.

Best practices in candidate variant selection protocols are basically 
standardised as of 2021, 
so the main remaining task is standardisation of the protein-pathway 
annotation and association testing methods - 
steps which we will soon be ready to publish after peer-review.

# Abstract

Risk factors, gene to phenotype, are more complex that anticipated in early genomics. 
Genotype - phenotype
Molecular and evolutionary complexity.
Molecular contigency - chance driven mutation, redundancy, molectular pathway cross-over (shared phenotypes).
Necessary complexity versus unnecessary - evolutionary baggage due to molecular constraint and blind evolution. 

# Introduction

&quot;Two individuals bearing the same set of risk factors may not present (or exhibit the symptoms of) the same disease. This is the kind of problem that precision medicine is expected to overcome.&quot;
From familial studies, we often see that even clear monogenic, dominant disease does not always manifest equally among family members. &quot;The lack of genetic determinism in disease is the result of molecular contingency.&quot;

An interesting point is made that I haven&apos;t though much about; &quot;Whether evolution is deterministic, i.e., predictable and repeatable, or contingent and unpredictable is an interesting topic in evolutionary biology (ref 1) (for a recent review see ref. 2)&quot;
Although, this is just a smaller version of a question in physics that I do think about frequently: if every irreducibly small particle/force in the universe could be detected with a mapped trajectory, then we could &quot;see&quot; both forward and reverse in time; causal determinism. Since the particle physics answer will not come anytime soon, a discussion on the evolutionary version is reasonable. 

&quot;..phenotypic evolutionary ârepeatabilityâ is common when the founding populations are closely related, perhaps resulting from shared genes and developmental pathways, whereas different outcomes become more likely as historical divergences increase.&quot;

I believe that in some cases we can produces actionable levels of confidence in mutation prediction to make this a worthwhile endeavour. Knowing that a mutation is likely to occur (and be evolutionarily selected against) and result in disease means that we can prepare a treatment / cure for when it does occur naturally. 
For example, each nucleotide within each individual cell will have a particular probability for the energy required to mutate. 
Many factors affect this value; nucleotide type, methylation, DNA/RNA folding, bound proteins, chemical/UV insult, etc. 
Some of these factors can be estimated based on large studies, and some may never be quantifiable in the real world.
However, we can at least quantify some values to produce mutation predictor value X and and response Y and therefore quantify estimate coefficients, and therefore predict that mutation 1 is more likely to occur than mutation 2. 

Reference is made to &quot;âEvolution and Tinkering,â Jacob (ref 4)&quot; who compares natural selection to a tinkerer as opposed to an engineer.
Singh and Gupta propose &quot;a theory of molecular complexity, consisting of necessary and unnecessary complexity in living systems&quot;, that &quot;exceedingly high level of unnecessary complexity&quot; is more due to blind evolution rather than randomness of mutation. 
&quot;Unecessary and unnecessary complexity is relevant to current discussions on genomics and precision medicine.&quot;
