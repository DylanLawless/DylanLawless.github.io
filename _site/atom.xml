  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying pathogenic variants with whole genome and whole exome sequencing is not simple.
Determining the correct filtering method can take some time but it is not the most difficult task.
Validating genetic factors is generally the most time consuming part of this type of research. 
Here is a compilation of some of the websites and resources that I use constantly.
I will begin this simply as a list but continue to contribute information on how to use all of these over time.
I use most of the listed resources daily.
There are several steps in assessing if a gene variant is a good candidate to explain a clinical phenotype.
Often a clear story can be made between the genetic mutation and the resulting phenotype.
Other times (usually) a genetic finding (particularly biallelic mutations) seem to have a direct link to the clinical phenotype but it can take  weeks-months to functionally validate such a finding.
 With that in mind, it is good to have some sort of routine way to quickly assess the possible pathogenicity of a mutation by hand.
I will mostly discuss these in the context of rare mutations which are likely to be under selective pressure and occur at very low frequencies in a healthy population.
 Sites and tools for getting basic genetic information For assessing rare variants Ensembl and Exac (now gnomAD) are my bread and butter.
I haven’t done it yet but I need to set up a hotkey to open a browser with both of these sites simultaneously.
To demonstrate how I like to use these we could use an example. Lets say we have NGS results for a patient with immunodeficiency with coding variants in the gene RAG2.
OK, well known gene, important for antibody production as wells as TCR and BCR development.
Looks good so far.
Let’s see if the variants are common SNPs or could they be likely to cause damage if they are not reported (of course this is in your pipeline automatically but it’s good practice and takes less than 60 seconds; valuable if there is a real person affected by your results).
 After a long time getting confused about transcripts and coordinates, I now know how important it is to accurately report coordinates so there is no confusion if collaborating or reporting the mutations etc. Jump over to Exac.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://exac.broadinstitute.org&quot;&gt;Exac.org&lt;/a&gt;
 This is in a nutshell, the exomes of ~ 60,000 individuals which can be used to view how frequently mutations occur in the general population (unfortunately it is mostly just European but there is some global representation). Exac is vital for checking coding variants.
It covers some of the intronic regions (exon intron splice sites) and some of the upstream and downstream regions.
This is typical for anyone who does whole exome sequencing.
 We mentioned confusion about transcripts and coordinates, Exac automatically loads the coverage as shown for the canonical transcript. Stick with this transcript for reporting or at least for your own notes.
When you head over to Ensembl grab the same one in the transcript table. Update! &lt;a href=&quot;http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/about&quot;&gt;The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) is online&lt;/a&gt;. This data set is the combination of “123,136 exomes and 15,496 genomes from unrelated individuals” which has “removed individuals known to be affected by severe pediatric disease, as well as their first-degree relatives.”
This is n extremely exciting resource. If you are familiar with Exac then you will know the value of this expansion into gnomAD. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_uRuFZv4JaU&quot;&gt;youtube.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ensembl.org/index.html&quot;&gt;Ensembl&lt;/a&gt; Any good pipeline will have annotation of the details for any coding variants but it can be pretty valuable to go and look at these again by hand.
It doesn’t take long but can end up saving time in the long run.
If you do it often, the first check on Exac take less than 60 seconds.
The next check on Ensemble will only take 2-3 minutes.
In the quick search I plug in the gene name, luckily for my stuff the top hit is always the human gene (sorry Alpaca researchers).
When you get to the gene page first click is always “Show transcript table.”
If you are lucky there is only one coding transcript like for RAG2.
Most of the time there are about 6 transcripts of wildly varying lengths just to confuse matters.
Go for the transcript ID of the canonical transcript which you noted on Exac.
If you do so then life will be easier when you go to check the coordinates. 
On the left hand side in the table “Transcript-based displays” click “cDNA” shown under “Sequence”.
You can then search through to find the variant and amino acid to see if everything lines up.
You see the cDNA position and amino acid positions overlaid. If you were to pick a different transcript then of course the coordinates are likely to be different.
From here I usually go back to the table on the left of the screen to search Exons.
This obviously just lays out the exon sequences  in blocks along with useful information.
Only a small segment of the introns are displayed.
If you want reference sequences of multiple types just find the down load sequence button and chose FASTA and decide which type you want to display. You would likely have the information based on the annotated NGS data but you may want to look at the different transcripts and Ensembl is the best option. So far (in just a couple of minutes) you could have looked up the allele frequencies, affect of mutation on different transcripts and check that everything that should be reported from the NGS output matches up.
My next step is to check if these variants a already reported.
Everyone has their favourite method, searching PubMed etc. For my topics OMIM often produces good results and a quick search. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omim.org/&quot;&gt;Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man&lt;/a&gt;
This is a curated database and is generally very good.
Hopefully it continues to grow for a long time into the future.
Depending on how much you already know about your gene it is sometimes helpful to jump straight down to the “Allelic variants” section (if one is present).
You may find a few variants already reported with a similar phenotype being described as your case.
You may find the exact mutations already reported.
If this is the case then it is likely that it would have taken a few minutes longer to find the same cases on one of the other databases.
Whether you have found that there are many mutations reported similar to those that interest you or if you have found nothing reported so far, my next step is always to run through UniProt.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uniprot.org&quot;&gt;UniProt&lt;/a&gt;
UniProt is so rich in information that there is no need to expnad on it here.
If you have never used it then just pick your favourite protein and go look it up now.
There is (usually) a combination of nearly everything you need to get a quick overview of a protein.
Gene function, functional domains, known variants, reported knockouts/mutagenesis studies, protein structures, expression, localisation, the list goes on.
Actually, as much as I love PDB, I find that using UniProt is usually quicker to check for available PDB protein structures before actually going to PDB to download from the source.
With these four websites one would likely be able to decide how confident you are about a candidate mutation/s.
At least if you are just looking coding variants.
Assessing non-coding regions is much messier business.
From here on in validation of a mutation can require a widely variable amount of functional work.
One thing is certain however, Sanger sequencing will be needed to confirm your NGS finding. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3amsDkyiMu8&quot;&gt;youtube.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gantzgraf/autoprimer3/releases/tag/v3.0.2&quot;&gt;Autoprimer3&lt;/a&gt;
Autoprimer3 is an excellent application that you can use to design primers for a gene of interest.
It is super quick for producing primers to be used on genomic DNA for “any UCSC genome and design PCR/sequencing primers to genes or genome coordinates”.
As an example I timed myself to see how long it takes to get a primer list for all exons of the gene RAG2 and a reference sequence from default genomic coordinates on hg38 while avoiding SNPs based on dbsnp142.
It took me 46 seconds to open the application and produce a primer list and reference sequence.
Less than 1% of the time I may have to go and redesign a primer manually because of an awkward sequence or a patient’s DNA may have some uncommon variant at the primer site. 
Depending on which supplier you order oligos from, Sanger sequencing to confirm a variant by found during NGS can be done within 3 days; about 90 seconds to design and order the oligos, a day or 2 until they are delivered,  and a day to PCR and sequence.
The explanation may be a bit long winded here but this app is excellent.
Just give it a try if you do any routine PCR or sequencing for coding variant.
As the name suggests, it is a simple version of Primer3 but super quick.

GATK most useful to jump straight to: &lt;a href=&quot;https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/&quot;&gt;Tool Documentation Index&lt;/a&gt; Genome hg38 &lt;a href=&quot;http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/das/hg38/dna?segment=chr7:142299011,142813287&quot;&gt;(TCR region as example)&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to reinvent the wheel here. Stephen Turner has a better list of resources than I will produce with his post ”Staying Current in Bioinformatics &amp;amp; Genomics: 2017 Edition.” 
http://www.gettinggeneticsdone.com/2017/02/staying-current-in-bioinformatics-genomics-2017.html
Essentially it boils down to the journals, Twitter, some expert blogs, and several genomics communities.
The journals and other sites I like to follow are detailed here. When all directed into a single feed I think it produces an essential resource for most genetics/bioinformatics scientists.
Literature of Interest - In this post I show the use of Feedly to condense all the litereature that I follow into a single source and allow the option to view by category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;10 Nov 2016 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a story about a company called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://snyk.io/blog/welcome-ruby-users/&quot;&gt;Snyk&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “sneak”), their
founder Guy Podjarny, my decision to become one of their advisors, and how they
are going to help save you from malevolent agents trying to steal your digital
stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re anything like me, you’re simultaneously terrified and in awe of the
increasing commonality of large corporate security breaches. Even big names like
Ebay, Home Depot, Anthem, JP Morgan Chase, Target, LinkedIn, Dropbox, and Yahoo
are falling victim to sophisticated attacks. If you spend even a few minutes
looking into it, you’ll be shocked at how frequently these breaches are
happening now. The fine folks at Information is Beautiful have an excellent
interactive visualization of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/&quot;&gt;World’s Biggest Data
Breaches&lt;/a&gt;
over the last twelve years, in case you want to read all the gory details and
never get a restful night of sleep ever again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2016-11-10/breaches.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve used a fair number of emotionally charged words above that might be
triggering your FUD detectors right about now. But be advised: it’s not paranoia
when they really are out to get you. If recent, extremely high profile (and
subsequently weaponized) breaches like those of the Clinton Campaign and the DNC
aren’t enough to make you want to air gap your entire life, then I envy your
steely-eyed mettle and implore you to teach me your meditation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, security is hard. And it’s getting harder every day. To win, you
have to get it right every single time. To lose (and lose big), you only have to
screw it up once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my years at GitHub, I spent a lot of time assembling a dedicated security
team, managing security audits and penetration tests, and working to establish a
culture of security awareness amongst our development team. All of this is
challenging and expensive, especially for a young company. Even worse, it’s the
kind of investment that’s totally invisible when it’s working, making it hard to
sustain until that crucial and terrible moment you end up on the front page of
Hacker News as the latest victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago I was contemplating this, especially the difficult proposition of
having developers, furious at work on new features, constantly maintain
awareness of security vulnerabilities they might be inadvertently weaving into
the product. Web application developers are generally not security experts, and
though I would love to live in a world where that wasn’t true, it’s just not a
realistic expectation. Meanwhile, modern development means an increasing
reliance on 3rd party code. Even a small Rails app will probably have 300 or
more gem dependencies after a few months of development. It’s even more in the
nodejs world. This level of modularization and code reuse, driven by the
explosion of high quality open source over the last decade, is amazing and I
absolutely love it, but it comes at a security expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source projects are not known for their excellent security records.
Vulnerabilities like &lt;a href=&quot;http://heartbleed.com/&quot;&gt;Heartbleed&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-shellshock/&quot;&gt;Shellshock&lt;/a&gt; painfully
demonstrate the idea that “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow” is
completely false. In fact, due to a flaw in YAML, Rails had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2013/01/10/rails-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-explained/&quot;&gt;pretty extreme
remote code execution
vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;
for years. If you were running any version of Rails prior to the fix, you were
vulnerable. This stuff is real, and as responsible developers, we need to be
more proactive about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, at the time I was pondering these matters, I ran into Guy Podjarny. As
a former cofounder of Blaze.io and then CTO of Web Experience at Akamai (which
acquired Blaze.io), Guy intimately understands the impact of security on today’s
web developers. He was working on an automated tool to scan and fix security
vulnerabilities in 3rd party dependencies. I was intrigued. They already had a
way to scan nodejs projects and look for known security vulnerabilities in the
dependency tree and automatically upgrade or patch affected libraries. I thought
this was pretty cool, but it was his vision for what automated security tooling
could be that sold me on him and his company. I can’t talk much about that
now, but just know that what Snyk is today is just the tip of what will
become an intelligent and proactive bodyguard for your entire codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, Snyk released GitHub integration to make it fantastically
simple to hook up your repos to Snyk and, my favorite feature: the ability to
monitor your repo for future vulnerabilities and then &lt;strong&gt;automatically submit a
pull request&lt;/strong&gt; with the suggested package upgrade or hotfix patch (nodejs only for
now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://snyk.io/blog/welcome-ruby-users/&quot;&gt;Snyk announced support for
Ruby&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look at that blog post,
it does an awesome job of explaining how simple it is to set up and what the
generated pull requests look like. It’s totally free for open source projects,
and extremely cheap insurance for your important projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, 3rd party code is a clear and present danger to your business.
If you don’t know if you’re vulnerable, then you must assume that you are and
take steps to protect yourself. Snyk makes it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#breaking&quot;&gt;Breaking crypto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quantum&quot;&gt;Quantum computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#thoughts&quot;&gt;Some thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#reading&quot;&gt;Reading list on more advanced topics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most of the posts on this blog, this will be a work in progress. Cryptography is a topic which I stumbled upon and really enjoy.
For the reading list skip to the end of this page.
There is a long interesting history which would appeal to a casual reader.
Most people would be familiar with stories about crypto during WWII, particularly because of movies like
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/&quot;&gt;The Imitation Game&lt;span id=&quot;titleYear&quot;&gt;(2014).
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Cracking of Enigma falls into the espionage theme along with stories like that of books from  &lt;span class=&quot;author notFaded&quot; style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a-declarative&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ben-Macintyre/e/B001H6WAL8/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1&quot;&gt;Ben Macintyre.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;One of my favorites is: &lt;span id=&quot;productTitle&quot; class=&quot;a-size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Operation-Mincemeat-True-Story-Changed-Course-World/1408809214&quot;&gt;Operation Mincemeat&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; The True Spy Story That Changed the Course of World War II. &lt;/span&gt;
Reading so much about the non-fiction side of this topic ultimately led me to the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_novels_and_short_stories&quot;&gt;Ian Flemming novels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Of course I had seen all the movies as a kid, and like most, loved them. Reading the novels in their order of release ended up being much more fun than I have with most fictional book series perhaps because of Flemming’s true involvements during WWII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gentle brushing against the topic of cryptography with these classical stories  eventually lead me to an interest in modern crypto. Real, crypto! Like most sciences portrayed in popular culture, it really only gets interesting when you get into the technical reading.
Computerphile has several good videos on cryptographic topics. This video describes SHA1 in a way that I find quite interesting. This is just about hashing methods but it is a lovely introduction to crypto.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY&quot;&gt;www.youtube.com&lt;/a&gt;
Another video from the series now gets to actual crypto  in the same entertaining way; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkV1KEJGKRA&quot;&gt;End to End Encryption (E2EE)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;breaking&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;breaking-crypto&quot;&gt;Breaking crypto&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning the basics of crypto and how it’s broken is best done at the same time. Of course actually breaking the crypto is difficult. But understanding it doesn’t have to be. To learn this you can quickly get the main points about modular arithmetic, exponentiation, and periods in this video.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Q3Mrh03Gk&quot;&gt;Shor’s algorithm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think getting a clear grasp on the topic relies on getting used to modular arithmetic. For example on a clock we use Mod 12. If you get up at 12am and the time is now 1pm well then obviously you have been up for 13 hours. &lt;strong&gt;13 mod 12 = 1&lt;/strong&gt;.
You know just as well that if you get up at 7am and it is now 8pm you have also been up for 13 hours. We can do this in our head very easily, and can do other examples easily too if you get over the initial confusion. &lt;strong&gt;A/B = Q remainder R&lt;/strong&gt;. In some cases we only care about the remainder R. In that case we say: &lt;strong&gt;A modulo B is equal to R&lt;/strong&gt;. Where B is referred to as the modulus (or mod for short).
The only difficulty is when the numbers become quite large.
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic&quot;&gt;Here is a page that describes this very well. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video is summed up with the 4 steps. The reason that RSA works is because Step 2, finding the period, takes a very long time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dylanlawlessblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/rsa.png&quot; alt=&quot;rsa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum computing is expected to dramatically speed up this step.
Another good intro video that has some interesting discussion on Diffie-Hellman key exchange was given at the Chaos Communication Congress:
J. Alex Halderman, Nadia Heninger: Logjam: Diffie-Hellman, discrete logs, the NSA, and you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Earlier this year, we discovered that Diffie-Hellman key exchange – cornerstone of modern cryptography – is less secure in practice than the security community believed. In this talk, we’ll explain how the NSA is likely exploiting this weakness to allow it to decrypt connections to at least 20% of HTTPS websites, 25% of SSH servers, and 66% of IPsec VPNs.”
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS8gm-_rJgM&quot;&gt;www.youtube.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied Cypto Handbook is a very good technical introduction and probably as far as a general reader will ever want to go.
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/&quot;&gt;http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;aes&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;aes-is-the-most-important-current-encryption-method&quot;&gt;AES is the most important current encryption method&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lecture is the perfect intro if you already know what methods are out there.

This might lead you down a wiki rabbit hole learning about interesting maths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;quantum&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quantum-computing&quot;&gt;Quantum computing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are simply two videos from PBS that will be more entertaining and succinct at discussing this really interesting topic than I.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrbJYsep45E&quot;&gt;How quantum computing works&lt;/a&gt;
How might quantum computing destroy computer security?
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUwZZaI5u0c&quot;&gt;By utilising Shor’s algorithm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fun little topic brought up in this videos is: that quantum Fourier transform uses resonance to amplify the basic state associated with the correct period.
If you’re reading this site then it’s likely that you are a biologist.
If that is the case you may be more familiar with protein structures than quantum mechanics.
I first became introduced to the practical application of Fourier transformation while learning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for protein structuring.
Of course, you don’t actually have to learn it to do NMR.
It happens automatically during data analysis but most people in the field surely would still like to know the details.
Wiki has a great page: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://dylanlawlessblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/ft.png&quot; alt=&quot;ft&quot; /&gt;
“In NMR an exponentially shaped free induction decay (FID) signal is acquired in the time domain and Fourier-transformed to a Lorentzian line-shape in the frequency domain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next main point addressed in this video is: Complex roots of unity.
This is introduced quite well in the video.
If you have never seen anything like this before then I highly recommend the short book by Feynman;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00BR40XJ6?ref_=k4w_oembed_ICZkE7ckZ2ZUfR&amp;amp;tag=kpembed-20&amp;amp;linkCode=kpd&quot;&gt;QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;!--
(https://www.amazon.com/QED-Strange-Princeton-Science-Library/dp/0691164096/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494067439&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=qed+the+strange+theory+of+light+and+matter)
--&gt;
In no way does this little book talk about quantum computing.
If fact it is pretty old now and is not the kind of thing that professionals will be using for reference.
Why would I suggest this for someone who is new to the topic? Well it is an extremely fun introduction to the topic of QED and lays the foundation of ideas that have become mainstream over the next 30 years.
Understanding some basic ideas will leave you open to recognise more complex applications, especially important if you want to only look at the basics of quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;some-thoughts&quot;&gt;Some thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk at Google by Peter Warren Singer based on his book,
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cybersecurity-Cyberwar-Everyone-Needs-Know%C2%AE/dp/0199918112&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity and Cyberwar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
may be a pretty interesting watch for anyone into technology security in some way. This is not a technical talk, more of something to get you into the mindset up why this topic may be interesting.

&lt;p&gt;The cryptopals crypto challenges are a fun way to learn some hands on application of cryptographic techniques. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptopals.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.cryptopals.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announcing the first SHA1 collision on February 23, 2017.
This was a really big event in the crypto community.
I think many people in the cyber security field assume that experiments and findings in public and academic research are a few years behind government capabilities.
Take from that what you will.
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html&quot;&gt;https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are countless reasons why crypto is interesting.
The applications range from the most mundane day to day requirements in the modern world such as banking, personal communication, the use of medical data (which I post about here &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dylanlawlessblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/21/pretty-good-privacy-for-academic-data/&quot;&gt;Pretty good privacy for academic data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) all the way out to the most hypothetical academic applications.
An interesting point to think about is the journey that each data packet makes across the mystical &lt;em&gt;internet&lt;/em&gt;.
Most electronic communications travel across a number of boarders and further distances than most people will travel in their entire life.
Our world would not run very smoothly if all communication was sent in a readable format with no protection.
Here is some basic info on the infrastructure require for modern electronic communication:

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the topic, I found this video on the Cornwall cable landing station.
The physical infrastructure and engineering requirements of global communication are sometimes easy to forget if one spends more time on computer programming or mathematics

   <title>Snyk - Automatically Scan and Fix Ruby and Nodejs Vulnerabilities</title>
   <link href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2016/11/10/snyk.html"/>
   <updated>2016-11-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2016/11/10/snyk</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;snyk---automatically-scan-and-fix-ruby-and-nodejs-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Snyk - Automatically Scan and Fix Ruby and Nodejs Vulnerabilities&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;10 Nov 2016 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a story about a company called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://snyk.io/blog/welcome-ruby-users/&quot;&gt;Snyk&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “sneak”), their
founder Guy Podjarny, my decision to become one of their advisors, and how they
are going to help save you from malevolent agents trying to steal your digital
stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re anything like me, you’re simultaneously terrified and in awe of the
increasing commonality of large corporate security breaches. Even big names like
Ebay, Home Depot, Anthem, JP Morgan Chase, Target, LinkedIn, Dropbox, and Yahoo
are falling victim to sophisticated attacks. If you spend even a few minutes
looking into it, you’ll be shocked at how frequently these breaches are
happening now. The fine folks at Information is Beautiful have an excellent
interactive visualization of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/&quot;&gt;World’s Biggest Data
Breaches&lt;/a&gt;
over the last twelve years, in case you want to read all the gory details and
never get a restful night of sleep ever again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2016-11-10/breaches.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve used a fair number of emotionally charged words above that might be
triggering your FUD detectors right about now. But be advised: it’s not paranoia
when they really are out to get you. If recent, extremely high profile (and
subsequently weaponized) breaches like those of the Clinton Campaign and the DNC
aren’t enough to make you want to air gap your entire life, then I envy your
steely-eyed mettle and implore you to teach me your meditation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, security is hard. And it’s getting harder every day. To win, you
have to get it right every single time. To lose (and lose big), you only have to
screw it up once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my years at GitHub, I spent a lot of time assembling a dedicated security
team, managing security audits and penetration tests, and working to establish a
culture of security awareness amongst our development team. All of this is
challenging and expensive, especially for a young company. Even worse, it’s the
kind of investment that’s totally invisible when it’s working, making it hard to
sustain until that crucial and terrible moment you end up on the front page of
Hacker News as the latest victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago I was contemplating this, especially the difficult proposition of
having developers, furious at work on new features, constantly maintain
awareness of security vulnerabilities they might be inadvertently weaving into
the product. Web application developers are generally not security experts, and
though I would love to live in a world where that wasn’t true, it’s just not a
realistic expectation. Meanwhile, modern development means an increasing
reliance on 3rd party code. Even a small Rails app will probably have 300 or
more gem dependencies after a few months of development. It’s even more in the
nodejs world. This level of modularization and code reuse, driven by the
explosion of high quality open source over the last decade, is amazing and I
absolutely love it, but it comes at a security expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source projects are not known for their excellent security records.
Vulnerabilities like &lt;a href=&quot;http://heartbleed.com/&quot;&gt;Heartbleed&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-shellshock/&quot;&gt;Shellshock&lt;/a&gt; painfully
demonstrate the idea that “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow” is
completely false. In fact, due to a flaw in YAML, Rails had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2013/01/10/rails-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-explained/&quot;&gt;pretty extreme
remote code execution
vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;
for years. If you were running any version of Rails prior to the fix, you were
vulnerable. This stuff is real, and as responsible developers, we need to be
more proactive about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, at the time I was pondering these matters, I ran into Guy Podjarny. As
a former cofounder of Blaze.io and then CTO of Web Experience at Akamai (which
acquired Blaze.io), Guy intimately understands the impact of security on today’s
web developers. He was working on an automated tool to scan and fix security
vulnerabilities in 3rd party dependencies. I was intrigued. They already had a
way to scan nodejs projects and look for known security vulnerabilities in the
dependency tree and automatically upgrade or patch affected libraries. I thought
this was pretty cool, but it was his vision for what automated security tooling
could be that sold me on him and his company. I can’t talk much about that
now, but just know that what Snyk is today is just the tip of what will
become an intelligent and proactive bodyguard for your entire codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, Snyk released GitHub integration to make it fantastically
simple to hook up your repos to Snyk and, my favorite feature: the ability to
monitor your repo for future vulnerabilities and then &lt;strong&gt;automatically submit a
pull request&lt;/strong&gt; with the suggested package upgrade or hotfix patch (nodejs only for
now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://snyk.io/blog/welcome-ruby-users/&quot;&gt;Snyk announced support for
Ruby&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look at that blog post,
it does an awesome job of explaining how simple it is to set up and what the
generated pull requests look like. It’s totally free for open source projects,
and extremely cheap insurance for your important projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, 3rd party code is a clear and present danger to your business.
If you don’t know if you’re vulnerable, then you must assume that you are and
take steps to protect yourself. Snyk makes it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Replicated - An Easier Path from SaaS to Enterprise</title>
   <link href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2015/06/19/replicated.html"/>
   <updated>2015-06-19T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2015/06/19/replicated</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;replicated---an-easier-path-from-saas-to-enterprise&quot;&gt;Replicated - An Easier Path from SaaS to Enterprise&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;19 Jun 2015 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I’ve had a chance to learn a lot more about early stage
funding and made angel investments in a handful of startups. So far I’ve
restricted my involvement to companies with ideas in which I have significant
domain knowledge. I also insist on founders with relentless product focus, a
fierce desire to help their customers be more awesome, and excellent
communication skills. I recently met just such a company, with just such
founders, tackling a problem that has personally caused me much pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is &lt;a href=&quot;http://replicated.com&quot;&gt;Replicated&lt;/a&gt;, and founders Grant Miller
and Marc Campbell are making it easier to roll out an on-prem Enterprise
offering based on an existing cloud-based SaaS product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At GitHub, we burned through &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of developer cycles building our own
installer (several times), securing the installation environment, coding an
automated licensing management system, integrating single sign-on services
(LDAP, Active Directory, CAS, etc, etc), building out a searchable audit system,
supporting customer-reviewable support bundles (logs and other diagnostic
output), allowing numerous backup strategies, and countless other
Enterprise-specific features that were killing our Enterprise deals. All of this
on top of hiring and building out the necessary sales, support, and accounting
teams to create a smooth Enterprise experience for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replicated provides common Enterprise functionality (much of what I mentioned
above, and all of it eventually) that you can wrap around your SaaS product,
resulting in a first-class on-prem product in a fraction of the time. Beyond
just technology, Replicated will help you understand your Enterprise customers
through documentation on best practices and insight into the requirements and
reasons that large companies desire the features they do. Until you can
empathise with your customer (which is very hard to do as a fast-moving SaaS
startup), you’ll never build the best product possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting into the Enterprise market will always be hard. But by reducing the
technology burden, Replicated plans to erase much of the pain so you can focus
on the other human-centric tasks. Not only am I an investor in Replicated, I
believe in their mission and their founders so much that I’ve joined as an
advisor. I understand what the uphill slog of the SaaS to Enterprise climb feels
like, and I’m going to do my best to ensure you don’t have to suffer it as much
as I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also pleased to announce that Travis CI is now shipping their Enterprise
product using Replicated. To see what the installation process is like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViN-qkcovL0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;watch
Grant install Travis CI
Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; on a
fresh server in about seven minutes. For a deeper dive, Travis CI has also
published a blog post covering some of their process in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.travis-ci.com/2015-06-19-how-we-improved-travis-ci-installation/&quot;&gt;getting their
Enterprise installer ready using
Replicated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see other well-known startups launching (or
re-launching) Enterprise versions of their SaaS software on top of Replicated.
If you’re looking to do the same, and want to save yourself a lot of heartache,

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;farewell-github-hello-immersive-computing&quot;&gt;Farewell GitHub, Hello Immersive Computing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;21 Apr 2014 - New York City&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day at GitHub. Recent events have given me a lot of time to
reflect on what’s important to me, and I’ve decided to switch gears and focus on
building something from scratch again. Since visiting the Oculus VR team at
their office three months ago, I’ve come to believe that immersive computing
(aka virtual reality) is poised to rival the personal computer, the web, social
networking, and mobile devices in its impact. While the timing is more abrupt
than I had intended, with everything that’s happened, I think now is the right
time to do this, and I’d like to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I want to address the serious accusations that were made against me and
my family over the past month. With every decision I made at GitHub and in every
interaction I had with employees, I tried to treat people better than they
expected and to resolve conflict with empathy. Despite that, I’ve made mistakes,
and I am deeply sorry to anyone who was hurt by those mistakes. It devastates me
to know that I missed the mark, and I will strive to do better, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I want to be very clear about one thing: neither my wife, Theresa,
nor I have ever engaged in gender-based harassment or discrimination. The
results of GitHub’s independent investigation unequivocally confirm this and we
are prepared to fight any further false claims on this matter to the full extent
of the law. I believe in diversity and equality for all people in all
professions, especially the tech sector. It’s immensely important to me and I
will continue to do my very best to further that belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the investigation and all the attention surrounding it have me
concerned that remaining at GitHub would be a distraction for both me and the
company. I’m incredibly proud of what I’ve helped build at GitHub and I don’t
want the events of the past month to jeopardize that. I care too much about the
company and the people here to let that happen. The GitHub team is incredibly
strong, with fierce vision, and I have no doubt they will continue to
revolutionize software development for decades to come. Founding and building
GitHub has been the greatest adventure of my life. I’ve been so lucky to be on
this journey with such amazing, helpful, talented, and real people. I’m going to
miss working with such a great team, but I’m also insanely excited about the
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the early days of GitHub, I’ve wanted to create a different kind of
business. One that was &lt;a href=&quot;http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/10/18/optimize-for-happiness.html&quot;&gt;Optimized for
Happiness&lt;/a&gt;
and built atop a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0FzgvYxdvk&quot;&gt;Framework of
Happiness&lt;/a&gt;. One where great people
could work on hard problems together to create unbelievably good products. I
believe I was able to achieve a great deal of success with that model at GitHub,
even if things didn’t always go perfectly according to plan. All of this has
been a tremendous learning experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last January I stepped down as CEO and handed that role over to cofounder Chris
Wanstrath so I could focus on future-facing R&amp;amp;D projects with small teams. This
kind of rapid, team-based innovation is what I live for. During my time away
from GitHub I started experimenting with Go, OpenGL, and Unity with an eye
towards the software side of immersive computing. It felt really good to get
back into a code editor and challenge the deeply logical and analytical part of
my brain. I’ve enjoyed the challenges of learning how to lead a company with
hundreds of people, but it’s very hard for me to deny the allure of coding a
system that could once again change the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m telling you this because I think stealth mode is bullshit and if you feel
the same way I do about immersive computing then I want to talk with you about
it. For the next few months I’m going to be living in Manhattan. My wife,
Theresa, is currently participating in Techstars NYC as their very first
nonprofit. Her startup, &lt;a href=&quot;https://omakasecharity.org/&quot;&gt;The Omakase Charity&lt;/a&gt;,
helps donors learn about and support nonprofits that are changing the world with
technology. She’s one of the strongest and most thoughtful women I know, and I’m
hoping to help her succeed with her mission while I’m here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone that reached out to me over the last month, including the
generous team at Andreessen Horowitz. Your support has made a huge difference
and I’m truly excited for what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Like most of the posts on this blog, this will be a work in progress. Cryptography is a topic which I stumbled upon and really enjoy.
For the reading list skip to the end of this page.
There is a long interesting history which would appeal to a casual reader.
Most people would be familiar with stories about crypto during WWII, particularly because of movies like
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/">The Imitation Game<span id="titleYear">(2014).
</span></a></span>
Cracking of Enigma falls into the espionage theme along with stories like that of books from  <span class="author notFaded" style="color: #0000ff;"><span class="a-declarative"><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ben-Macintyre/e/B001H6WAL8/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1">Ben Macintyre.</a> </span></span>One of my favorites is: <span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Operation-Mincemeat-True-Story-Changed-Course-World/1408809214">Operation Mincemeat</a>:</span> The True Spy Story That Changed the Course of World War II. </span>
Reading so much about the non-fiction side of this topic ultimately led me to the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_novels_and_short_stories">Ian Flemming novels</a>.</span> Of course I had seen all the movies as a kid, and like most, loved them. Reading the novels in their order of release ended up being much more fun than I have with most fictional book series perhaps because of Flemming’s true involvements during WWII.</p>

<p>Gentle brushing against the topic of cryptography with these classical stories  eventually lead me to an interest in modern crypto. Real, crypto! Like most sciences portrayed in popular culture, it really only gets interesting when you get into the technical reading.
Computerphile has several good videos on cryptographic topics. This video describes SHA1 in a way that I find quite interesting. This is just about hashing methods but it is a lovely introduction to crypto.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY">www.youtube.com</a>
Another video from the series now gets to actual crypto  in the same entertaining way; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkV1KEJGKRA">End to End Encryption (E2EE)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="breaking"></a></p>
<h1 id="breaking-crypto">Breaking crypto</h1>
<p>Learning the basics of crypto and how it’s broken is best done at the same time. Of course actually breaking the crypto is difficult. But understanding it doesn’t have to be. To learn this you can quickly get the main points about modular arithmetic, exponentiation, and periods in this video.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Q3Mrh03Gk">Shor’s algorithm</a></p>

<p>I think getting a clear grasp on the topic relies on getting used to modular arithmetic. For example on a clock we use Mod 12. If you get up at 12am and the time is now 1pm well then obviously you have been up for 13 hours. <strong>13 mod 12 = 1</strong>.
You know just as well that if you get up at 7am and it is now 8pm you have also been up for 13 hours. We can do this in our head very easily, and can do other examples easily too if you get over the initial confusion. <strong>A/B = Q remainder R</strong>. In some cases we only care about the remainder R. In that case we say: <strong>A modulo B is equal to R</strong>. Where B is referred to as the modulus (or mod for short).
The only difficulty is when the numbers become quite large.
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic">Here is a page that describes this very well. </a></span></p>

<p>This video is summed up with the 4 steps. The reason that RSA works is because Step 2, finding the period, takes a very long time:</p>

<p><img src="https://dylanlawlessblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/rsa.png" alt="rsa" /></p>

<p>Quantum computing is expected to dramatically speed up this step.
Another good intro video that has some interesting discussion on Diffie-Hellman key exchange was given at the Chaos Communication Congress:
J. Alex Halderman, Nadia Heninger: Logjam: Diffie-Hellman, discrete logs, the NSA, and you.</p>

<p>“Earlier this year, we discovered that Diffie-Hellman key exchange – cornerstone of modern cryptography – is less secure in practice than the security community believed. In this talk, we’ll explain how the NSA is likely exploiting this weakness to allow it to decrypt connections to at least 20% of HTTPS websites, 25% of SSH servers, and 66% of IPsec VPNs.”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS8gm-_rJgM">www.youtube.com</a></p>

<p>Applied Cypto Handbook is a very good technical introduction and probably as far as a general reader will ever want to go.
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/">http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/</a></span></p>

<p><a name="aes"></a></p>
<h1 id="aes-is-the-most-important-current-encryption-method">AES is the most important current encryption method</h1>
<p>This lecture is the perfect intro if you already know what methods are out there.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1v2tX4_dkQ">www.youtube.com</a>
The accompanying book is worth the money if you’re looking for a textbook. The table of contents is available on amazon.
<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a href="http://www.crypto-textbook.com">http://www.crypto-textbook.com.</a></span>
Here is a link to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Évariste_Galois#Galois_theory">Galois’ wiki.</a></span>
This might lead you down a wiki rabbit hole learning about interesting maths.</p>

<p><a name="quantum"></a></p>
<h1 id="quantum-computing">Quantum computing</h1>
<p>Here are simply two videos from PBS that will be more entertaining and succinct at discussing this really interesting topic than I.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrbJYsep45E">How quantum computing works</a>
How might quantum computing destroy computer security?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUwZZaI5u0c">By utilising Shor’s algorithm</a></p>

<p>A fun little topic brought up in this videos is: that quantum Fourier transform uses resonance to amplify the basic state associated with the correct period.
If you’re reading this site then it’s likely that you are a biologist.
If that is the case you may be more familiar with protein structures than quantum mechanics.
I first became introduced to the practical application of Fourier transformation while learning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for protein structuring.
Of course, you don’t actually have to learn it to do NMR.
It happens automatically during data analysis but most people in the field surely would still like to know the details.
Wiki has a great page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform</a>
<img src="https://dylanlawlessblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/ft.png" alt="ft" />
“In NMR an exponentially shaped free induction decay (FID) signal is acquired in the time domain and Fourier-transformed to a Lorentzian line-shape in the frequency domain.”</p>

<p>The next main point addressed in this video is: Complex roots of unity.
This is introduced quite well in the video.
If you have never seen anything like this before then I highly recommend the short book by Feynman;
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00BR40XJ6?ref_=k4w_oembed_ICZkE7ckZ2ZUfR&amp;tag=kpembed-20&amp;linkCode=kpd">QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter</a>
<!--
(https://www.amazon.com/QED-Strange-Princeton-Science-Library/dp/0691164096/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1494067439&sr=1-1&keywords=qed+the+strange+theory+of+light+and+matter)
-->
In no way does this little book talk about quantum computing.
If fact it is pretty old now and is not the kind of thing that professionals will be using for reference.
Why would I suggest this for someone who is new to the topic? Well it is an extremely fun introduction to the topic of QED and lays the foundation of ideas that have become mainstream over the next 30 years.
Understanding some basic ideas will leave you open to recognise more complex applications, especially important if you want to only look at the basics of quantum computing.</p>

<p><a name="thoughts"></a></p>
<h1 id="some-thoughts">Some thoughts</h1>
<p>This talk at Google by Peter Warren Singer based on his book,
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cybersecurity-Cyberwar-Everyone-Needs-Know%C2%AE/dp/0199918112">Cybersecurity and Cyberwar</a></span>,
may be a pretty interesting watch for anyone into technology security in some way. This is not a technical talk, more of something to get you into the mindset up why this topic may be interesting.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0SXO5KUZIo">www.youtube.com</a>

<p>The cryptopals crypto challenges are a fun way to learn some hands on application of cryptographic techniques. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.cryptopals.com/">http://www.cryptopals.com/</a></span></p>

<p>Announcing the first SHA1 collision on February 23, 2017.
This was a really big event in the crypto community.
I think many people in the cyber security field assume that experiments and findings in public and academic research are a few years behind government capabilities.
Take from that what you will.
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html">https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html</a></span></p>

<p>There are countless reasons why crypto is interesting.
The applications range from the most mundane day to day requirements in the modern world such as banking, personal communication, the use of medical data (which I post about here <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://dylanlawlessblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/21/pretty-good-privacy-for-academic-data/">Pretty good privacy for academic data</a></span>) all the way out to the most hypothetical academic applications.
An interesting point to think about is the journey that each data packet makes across the mystical <em>internet</em>.
Most electronic communications travel across a number of boarders and further distances than most people will travel in their entire life.
Our world would not run very smoothly if all communication was sent in a readable format with no protection.
Here is some basic info on the infrastructure require for modern electronic communication:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKHZKTRyzeg">www.youtube.com</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TZwiUwZwIE">www.youtube.com</a>
And the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.submarinecablemap.com">Submarine Cable Map</a></span>.</p>

<p>While we’re on the topic, I found this video on the Cornwall cable landing station.
The physical infrastructure and engineering requirements of global communication are sometimes easy to forget if one spends more time on computer programming or mathematics
