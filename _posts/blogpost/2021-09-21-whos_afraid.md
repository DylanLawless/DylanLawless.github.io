Familiarity with Genetics and Willingness to Donate

For people who are familiar with the concepts of DNA and genomics, an associated is seen in the willingness to donate DNA and medical information. 


The association, adjusted for sociodemographic factors, is shown in Figure 5. There was evidence for be- tween-country heterogeneity (I2 1⁄4 48% and I2 1⁄4 61% for fa- miliarity with genetics and personal experience, respec- tively). Compared to participants who were unfamiliar with genetics, those who were familiar or had personal expe- rience had greater odds of being willing to donate (odds ratio [OR] 1⁄4 1.85, 95% CI 1⁄4 1.11–2.00; OR 1⁄4 2.70, 95% CI 1⁄4 2.37– 3.09, respectively). The overall pattern of results was similar when considering single groups of recipients of donated DNA and medical information (doctors, non-profit re- searchers, for-profit researchers); shown in Figures S5–S7.
