## Evidence builder modules

Genomic analysis provides opportunity for discoveries in human health, precision medicine, clinical diagnosis, pharmacogenomics, pathogen epidemiology, drug discovery, agricultural development, food production, and a countless range of emerging applications. 
* The protocols required are traditionally well defined with best-practices established. 
* The application of interpretation guidelines are traditionally well established. 
* However, the current standard for combining protocols, evidence sources, and actionable result detection is very poor. 
Here we solve this problem in a modular, expandable, reliable format.
