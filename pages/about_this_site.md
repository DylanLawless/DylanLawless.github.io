# About this site

This website is pretty basic looking; what gives?

It is true that this website is rather simplistic looking.
There are several reasons for this.

1. Minimalism - I want to focus on content and not flash. The pages are being updated regularly, math notation should be rendered on every web browser that I have been able to test. Citations are working as expected for academic style publishing, and stored in a master bibliography file that could be downloaded freely. 
2. Built to be light and fast - web pages should load instantly. Even the most artistic designs should load quickly and use minimal data. 
3. Privacy - the site contains no ads, trackers, cookies, etc. I do not need to earn money by stealing your private information and I do not need to know how often you visit. Therefore, I do not include any of these systems. 
4. Logical reading - countless websites seems to arrange topics and pages in an illogical fashion. You should be able to intuitively navigate a site that is content-based and know whether something exists or not, rather than presuming that you just can't find the right hyperlink. Therefore I try to keep topics laid out linearly and orderly. Clicking Home will bring you back to the master list of topics so that you do not need to go on a clicking expedition.
5. Hand written - there are countless templates for slick looking landing pages and websites. However, to learn the skill of web design in depth, I have elected to write every line of code by hand; testing every element of content and design such as fonts, spacing, layout, drop down menu, etc. I personally design and draw logos branding, 404 pages, etc. R code is written and tested to illustrate datasets. The portfolio gallery layout was created custom as well as its contents. The website is responsive on both desktop and mobile using custom CSS, with font sizes for different screens and minor font alteration for legibility on mobile and desktop. Although the website may be simplistic, this system has provided me a chance to learn the basics in detail instead of using shortcuts. The content is written using markdown, built using Jekyll, and some plugins improve the formatting of LaTeX code, tables, and citations.
