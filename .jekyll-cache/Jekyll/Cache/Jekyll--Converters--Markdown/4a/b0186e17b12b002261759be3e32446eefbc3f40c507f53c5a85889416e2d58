<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>While widespread genome sequencing ushers in a new era of preventive medicine, the tools for predictive genomics are still lacking.
Time and resource limitations mean that human diseases remain uncharacterised because of an inability to predict clinically relevant genetic variants.
A strategy of targeting highly conserved protein regions is used commonly in functional studies. 
However, this benefit is lost for rare diseases where the attributable genes are mostly conserved. 
An immunological disorder exemplifying this challenge occurs through damaging mutations in <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> which presents at an early age with a distinct phenotype of life-threatening immunodeficiency or autoimmunity. 
Many tools exist for variant pathogenicity prediction but these cannot account for the probability of variant occurrence. 
Here, we present a method that predicts the likelihood of mutation for every amino acid residue in the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins. 
Population genetics data from approximately 146,000 individuals was used for rare variant
analysis. 
Forty-four known pathogenic variants reported in patients and recombination activity measurements from 110 RAG1/2 mutants were used to
validate calculated scores. 
Probabilities were compared with 98
currently known human cases of disease. 
A genome sequence dataset of 558
patients who have primary immunodeficiency but that are negative for RAG
deficiency were also used as validation controls. 
We compared the
difference between mutation likelihood and pathogenicity prediction. 
Our
method builds a map of most probable mutations allowing pre-emptive
functional analysis. 
This method may be applied to other diseases with
hopes of improving preparedness for clinical diagnosis.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Costs associated with genomic investigations continue to reduce
<a class="citation" href="#payne2018cost">(Payne et al., 2018)</a> while the richness of data generated increases.
Globally, the adoption of wide scale genome sequencing implies that all
new-born infants may receive screening for pathogenic genetic variants
in an asymptomatic stage, pre-emptively <a class="citation" href="#kwan2014newborn">(Kwan et al., 2014)</a>. 
The one
dimensionality of individual genomes is now being expanded by the
possibility of massive parallel sequencing for somatic variant analysis
and by single-cell or lineage-specific genotyping; culminating in a
genotype spectrum. 
In whole blood, virtually every nucleotide position
may be mutated across \(10^5\) cells <a class="citation" href="#Liggett208066">(Liggett et al., 2017)</a>. 
Mapping one’s
genotype across multiple cell types and at several periods during a
person’s life may soon be feasible <a class="citation" href="#clark2018scnmt">(Clark et al., 2018)</a>. 
Such genotype
snapshots might allow for prediction and tracking of somatic,
epigenetic, and transcriptomic profiling.</p>

<p>The predictive value of genomic screening highly depends on the
computation tools used for data analysis and its correlation with
functional assays or prior clinical experience. 
Interpretation of that
data is especially challenging for rare human genetic disorders;
candidate disease-causing variants that are predicted as pathogenic
often require complex functional investigations to confirm their
significance. 
There is a need for predictive genomic modelling with aims
to provide a reliable guidance for therapeutic intervention for patients
harbouring genetic defects for life-threatening disease before the
illness becomes clinically significant.</p>

<p>The study of predictive genomics is exemplified by consideration of gene
essentiality, accomplished by observing intolerance to loss-of-function
variants. 
Several gene essentiality scoring methods are available for
both the coding and non-coding genome <a class="citation" href="#bartha2017human">(Bartha et al., 2017)</a>. 
Approximately
3,000 human genes cannot tolerate the loss of one allele
<a class="citation" href="#bartha2017human">(Bartha et al., 2017)</a>. 
The greatest hurdle in monogenic disease is the
interpretation of variants of unknown significance while functional
validation is a major time and cost investment for laboratories
investigating rare disease.</p>

<p>Severe, life-threatening immune diseases are caused by genetic
variations in almost 300 genes
<a class="citation" href="#picard2018international">(Picard et al., 2018; Conley &amp; Casanova, 2014)</a> however, only a small
percentage of disease causing variants have been characterised using
functional studies. 
Several robust tools are in common usage for
predicting variant pathogenicity. 
Compared to methods for pathogenicity
prediction, a void remains for predicting mutation probability,
essential for efficient pre-emptive validation. 
Our investigation aims
to apply predictive genomics as a tool to identify genetic variants that
are most likely to be seen in patient cohorts.</p>

<p>We present the first application of our novel approach of predictive
genomics using Recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2
deficiency as a model for a rare primary immunodeficiency (PID) caused
by autosomal recessive variants. 
<em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> encode
lymphoid-specific proteins that are essential for V(D)J recombination.
This genetic recombination mechanism is essential for a robust immune
response by diversification the T and B cell repertoire in the thymus
and bone marrow, respectively <a class="citation" href="#schatz1989v">(Schatz et al., 1989; Oettinger et al., 1990)</a>.
Deficiency of RAG1 <a class="citation" href="#mombaerts1992rag">(Mombaerts et al., 1992)</a> and RAG2 <a class="citation" href="#shinkai1992rag">(Shinkai et al., 1992)</a> in
mice causes inhibition of B and T cell development. 
@schwarz1996rag
formed the first publication reporting that RAG mutations in humans
causes severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and deficiency in
peripheral B and T cells. 
Patient studies identified a form of immune
dysregulation known as Omenn syndrome
<a class="citation" href="#de1991restricted">(de Saint-Basile et al., 1991; Rieux-Laucat et al., 1998)</a>. 
The patient phenotype includes
multi-organ infiltration with oligoclonal, activated T cells. 
The first
reported cases of Omenn syndrome identified infants with hypomophic RAG
variants which retained partial recombination activity
<a class="citation" href="#villa1998partial">(Villa et al., 1998)</a>. 
RAG deficiency can be measured by in vitro
quantification of recombination activity
<a class="citation" href="#lawless2018prevalence">(Lawless et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2014; Tirosh et al., 2018)</a>.
Hypomorphic <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> mutations, responsible for residual V(D)J
recombination activity (on average 5-30%), result in a distinct
phenotype of combined immunodeficiency with granuloma and/or
autoimmunity (CID-G/A)
<a class="citation" href="#kwan2014newborn">(Kwan et al., 2014; Walter et al., 2015; Schuetz et al., 2008)</a>.</p>

<p>Human RAG deficiency has traditionally been identified at very early
ages due to the rapid drop of maternally-acquired antibody in the first
six months of life. 
A loss of adequate lymphocyte development quickly
results in compromised immune responses. 
More recently, we have found
that RAG deficiency is also found for some adults living with PID
<a class="citation" href="#lawless2018prevalence">(Lawless et al., 2018)</a>.</p>

<p><em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> are highly conserved genes but disease is only
reported with autosomal recessive inheritance. 
Only 44% of amino acids
in RAG1 and RAG2 are reported as mutated on GnomAD and functional
validation of candidate variants is difficult <a class="citation" href="#lek2016analysis">(Lek et al., 2016)</a>.
Pre-emptive selection of residues for functional validation is a major
challenge; a selection based on low allele frequency alone is infeasible
since the majority of each gene is highly conserved. 
A shortened time
between genetic analysis and diagnosis means that treatments may be
delivered earlier. 
RAG deficiency may present with diverse phenotypes
and treatment strategies vary. 
With such tools, early intervention may
be prompted. 
Some patients could benefit from hematopoietic stem cell
transplant <a class="citation" href="#john2016unrelated">(John et al., 2016)</a> when necessary while others may be
provided mechanism-based treatment <a class="citation" href="#casanova2014guidelines">(Casanova et al., 2014)</a>. 
Here, we
provide a new method for predictive scoring that was validated against
groups of functional assay values, human disease cases, and population
genetics data. 
We present the list of variants most likely seen as
future determinants of RAG deficiency, meriting functional
investigation.</p>

<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>

<h2 id="population-genetics-and-data-sources">Population genetics and data sources</h2>

<p>GnomAD (version r2.0.2) <a class="citation" href="#lek2016analysis">(Lek et al., 2016)</a> was queried for the canonical
transcripts of <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> from population genetics data of
approximately 146,000 individuals; ENST00000299440 (<em>RAG1</em>) 1586
variants, GRCh37 11:36532259-36614706 and ENST00000311485 (<em>RAG2</em>) 831
variants, GRCh37 11:36597124 - 36619829. 
Data was filtered to contain
the variant effect identifiers: frameshift, inframe deletion, inframe
insertion, missense, stop lost, or stop gained. 
Reference transcripts
were sourced from Ensembl in the FASTA format amino acid sequence for
transcript RAG1-201 ENST00000299440.5 [HGNC:9831\%} and transcript
RAG2-201 ENST00000311485.7 [HGNC:9832\%}. 
These sequences were converted
to their three-letter code format using <em>One to Three</em> from the Sequence
Manipulation Suite (SMS2) <a class="citation" href="#stothard2000sequence">(Stothard, 2000)</a>. 
Combined Annotation
Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores were sourced from (Nov 2018) and are
reported by @kircher2014general. 
The dataset used was “All possible
SNVs” from whole genome data, from which we extracted the data for
coding regions of <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em>. 
We used the Human Gene Mutation
Database (HGMD) from the Institute of Medical Genetics in Cardiff as a
pre-defined source of known RAG deficiency cases (Feb 2019, free access
version to NM_000448.2.) <a class="citation" href="#stenson2014human">(Stenson et al., 2014)</a>. 
Data was formatted into
CSV and imported into R for combined analysis with PHRED-scaled CADD
scores and the main dataframe. 
The crystal structure render of DNA bound
RAG complex was produced with data from RCSB Protein Data Bank
(3jbw.pdb) <a class="citation" href="#ru2015molecular">(Ru et al., 2015)</a>. 
Structures were visualised using the
software VMD from the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group
<a class="citation" href="#Humphrey1996vmd">(Humphrey et al., 1996)</a>, imaged with Tachyon rendering <a class="citation" href="#Stone1998Ane">(Stone, 1998)</a>, and
colour mapped using our scoring method.</p>

<h2 id="data-processing">Data processing</h2>

<p>The population genetics input dataset used GnomAD variant allele
frequencies and reference sequences processed as CSV files, cleaned and
sorted to contain only amino acid codes, residue numbers, alternate
residues, alternate allele frequencies, and a score of 0 or 1 to
indicate presence or absence of variants where 1 represented none
reported. 
An annotation column was also provided to label where multiple
alternate variants existed. 
Statistics and calculation steps are listed
in order in Supplemental Tables E3-E8.</p>

<p>The percentage of conserved residues was calculated (55.99% of amino
acids contained no reported variants in RAG1, 55.98% in RAG2 (
Table E4). 
Basic protein statistics were generated using
canonical reference transcript sequences of <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> with the
SMS2 tool <em>Protein Stats</em> <a class="citation" href="#stothard2000sequence">(Stothard, 2000)</a>. 
The resulting pattern
percentage value was converted to a frequency (decimal 0-1) based on the
number of residues per protein to generate the residue frequency
(\({R}_{f}\)). 
The \({R}_{f}\) values were found for both proteins as shown
in <strong>Table E5</strong> and summarised in <strong>Table E6</strong>.</p>

<p>The count of variants per residue were found for both proteins and the
mutation rates (\({M}_{r}\)) per residue were calculated as shown in
** Table E7**. 
\({M}_{r}\) was found by counting the number of
mutations per residue in a window, sized to contain each protein
individually. 
For genome-wide application the window size may be
increased or decreased. 
In this case the window consisted of only the
coding regions. 
The \({M}_{r}\) values were then converted to the
frequencies based on the number of residues per protein. 
Separate, and
overlapping windows could also be used based on genome phase data and
regions of linkage disequilibrium to account for non-random association
of alleles at different loci; this might be particularly important for
disorders with multiple genetic determinants.</p>

<p>The \({M}_{r}\) and \({R}_{f}\) multiply to give the raw mutation rate
residue frequency (MRF) value (<strong>Table E8\%}</strong>). 
This value is
also shown in <strong>Tables mrf.assay\%} and [Table:1\%}</strong>. 
Our
investigation used a Boolean score \(C\) to account for the presence or
absence of a mutation in the general population; 0 for any variant
existing in the population and 1 for conserved residues.
\(C \times {M}_{r} \times  {R}_{f}\), in our case, produced the MRF score
for conserved residues. 
<strong>Figure 
<img />Figure_main\%} (ii)</strong> illustrates
the raw MRF as a histogram and the MRF, after applying \(C\), as a
heatmap.</p>

<p>An important consideration for future application is whether to use this
Boolean score or instead use a discrete variable which accounts for the
true allele frequency in the general population. 
In the clinical
setting, the likelihood of <em>de novo</em> mutations and inherited mutations
have different impacts when considering recessive and dominant diseases.
A patient is more likely to inherit a variant that exists even at a very
low frequency than to acquire a random <em>de novo</em> mutation. 
Therefore, a
value representing an allele frequency may be used to replace \(C\) in
many investigations, particularity when considering variants that exist
at low rates. 
PRHED-scaled CADD score data consisted of nucleotide level
values. 
For comparison with MRF, the median CADD scores were averaged
per codon as demonstrated in text.

analysis is illustrated in <strong>Figure

<h2 id="data-visualisation">Data visualisation</h2>

<p>For our visualisation of MRF scores, small clusters of high MRF values
were of more appealing than individual highly conserved residues.
Therefore, we applied a 1% average filter where values were averaged
over a sliding window of N number of residues (10 in the case of RAG1, 6
in the case of RAG2). 
For a clear distinction of MRF clusters, a cut-off
threshold was applied at the 75\(^{th}\) percentile (e.g. 
0.0168 in RAG1)
as shown in heatmaps in <strong>Figure 
<img />Figure_main\%} (iii)</strong> and

<h2 id="validation-of-mrf-against-functional-data">Validation of MRF against functional data</h2>

<p>The recombination activity of RAG1 and RAG2 was previously measured on
known or candidate pathogenic variants
<a class="citation" href="#lee2014systematic">(Lee et al., 2014; Lawless et al., 2018; Tirosh et al., 2018)</a>.
Briefly, the pathogenicity of variants in <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> was measured
functionally <em>in vitro</em> by either expression of RAG1 and RAG2 in
combination with a recombination substrate plasmid containing
recombination signal sequence (RSS) sites which are targeted by RAG
complex during normal V(D)J recombination, or Abelson virus-transformed
Rag2-/- pro-B cells with an RSS-flanked inverted GFP cassette.
Recombination events were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR using
comparative CT or expression of GFP evaluated by flow cytometry,
respectively. 
The inverse score of recombination activity (0-100%) was
used to quantify pathogenicity of variants in our study. 
Comparison
between known pathogenicity scores and MRF was done by scaling MRF
scores from 0-100% (100% being highest probability of occurring as
damaging). 
A data and analysis is summarised in **Figure</p>

<p>Variant probability prediction is dependent on population genetics data.
Our study queried GnomAD <a class="citation" href="#lek2016analysis">(Lek et al., 2016)</a> to identify conserved
residues using a Boolean score \(C\) of 0 (present in population) or 1
(conserved). 
The gene-specific mutation rate \({M}_{r}\) of each residue
was calculated from allele frequencies. 
The gene-specific residue
frequency \({R}_{f}\) represented the frequency of a residue occurring per
gene, acquired by converting gene residue percentage (from the SMS2 tool
<em>Protein stats</em>) to a frequency (decimal 0-1) <a class="citation" href="#stothard2000sequence">(Stothard, 2000)</a>.
Together the values were used to calculate the most probable
disease-causing variants which have not yet been identified in patients.
We termed the resulting score a mutation rate residue frequency, where
\(MRF = {C} \times {M}_{r} \times {R}_f\). 
This score represents the
likelihood that a clinically relevant mutation will occur.</p>

<h2 id="figure">Figure</h2>
<p><img />Figure_main\%}** presents the most probable unidentified

[<em>originally compiled by</em> @notarangelo2016human\%}. 
This dataset
compares a total of 44 variants. 
We expected that functionally damaging
variants (resulting in low recombination activity in vitro) that have
the highest probability of occurrence would be identified with high MRF
scores. 
MRF prediction correctly identified clinically relevant
mutations in <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> (**Fig.</p>

<p><img />Human_cases\%} (i)<strong>).
Variants reported on GnomAD which are clinically found to cause disease
had significantly higher MRF scores than variants which have not been

<p>Allele frequency is generally the single most important filtering method
for rare disease in whole genome (and exome) sequencing experiments.
Variants under pressure from purifying selection are more likely to
cause disease than common variants. 
However, most RAG mutations are
rare. 
Therefore, allele frequencies of rare variants reported on GnomAD
cannot differentially predict the likelihood of causing disease (**Fig.</p>

<p><img />Human_cases\%} (ii)**). 
As such, we found no significant
difference between known damaging variants and those that have not yet
been reported as disease-causing. 
The comparison between **Figure</p>

<p><img />Human_cases\%} (i) and (ii)** illustrates the reasoning for the
design of our method.</p>

<p>Many non-clinically-reported rare variants may cause disease; the MRF
score identifies the top clinically relevant candidates. 
Based on the
frequency of protein-truncating variants in the general population,
<em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> are considered to be tolerant to the loss of one
allele, as indicated by their low probability of being loss-of-function
intolerant (pLI) scores of 0.00 and 0.01, respectively
<a class="citation" href="#lek2016analysis">(Lek et al., 2016)</a>. 
This is particularly important for recessive
diseases such as RAG deficiency where most new missense variants will be
of unknown significance until functionally validated.</p>

<h2 id="top-candidate-variants-require-validation">Top candidate variants require validation</h2>

<p>Functionally characterising protein activity is both costly and time
consuming. 
RAG1 and RAG2 have now been investigated by multiple
functional assays for at least 110 coding variants
<a class="citation" href="#lee2014systematic">(Lee et al., 2014; Tirosh et al., 2018; Lawless et al., 2018)</a>.
In each case, researchers selected variants in <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> that
were potentially damaging or were identified from PID patients as the
most probable genetic determinant of disease. 
Functional assays for RAG
deficiency in those cases, and generally, measured a loss of
recombination activity as a percentage of wild type function (0-100%).</p>

<p>Pre-emptively performing functional variant studies benefits those who
will be identified with the same variants in the future, before the

<p>If MRF scoring was used in the same cases pre-emptively, the loss of
investment would be minimal; only 8 variants out of 71 mutants tested
had an above-average MRF score while being measured as functionally
benign (a rate of 11.27%). 
RAG2 had only 3 out of 39 variants (7.69%)
with an above-average MRF score while functionally benign. 
For the
expended resources, approximately 30% more top candidates would have
been tested in place of unlikely and functionally non-damaging
mutations. 
However, the true measurement of accuracy is limited in that
very few of the most likely clinically relevant variants predicted by
MRF scoring have been tested to date.</p>

<p>We have previously measured the recombination activity of RAG1 and RAG2

We have compiled our own and other functional assay data from

RAG deficiency was measured as the level of recombination

Each method of investigation
simulated the efficiency of wild-type or mutant proteins expressed by
patients for their ability to produce a diverse repertoire of T-cell
receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) and coding for immunoglobulins.
In functional experiments, mutant proteins were assayed for their
ability to perform recombination on a substrate which mimics the RSS of
TCR and BCR in comparison to wild-type protein complex (as % SEM).</p>

<p>By gathering confirmed RAG deficiency cases, we compiled the MRF scores
for 43 damaging <em>RAG1</em> variants in 77 PID cases and 14 damaging <em>RAG2</em>
variants in 21 PID cases (MRF scores spanning over 22 categories). 
To
test our method against a strong control group, we identified coding
variants in patients with PID where RAG deficiency due to coding
variants has been ruled out as the cause of disease. 
We obtained
<em>RAG1/2</em> variants in 558 PID patients who had their genomes sequenced as
part of the NIHR BioResource - Rare Diseases study
<a class="citation" href="#lawless2018prevalence">(Lawless et al., 2018)</a>. 
Filtering initially identified 32 variants in
166 people. 
This set was trimmed to contain only rare variants; 29
variants over 26 MRF scoring categories from 72 cases of
non-RAG-deficient PID. 
The scatterplot in Figure 5 shows that most PID
cases had damaging variants with a high MRF score, while PID cases
carried benign variants in RAG1/2 with lower MRF scores; i.e. 
an MRF
&gt;0.04 was seen for 31 cases of a damaging variant and only 2 cases of
a non-damaging variant. 
Linear regression on this control group produced
negative or near-zero slopes for <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em>, respectively. 
The

<p>CADD scoring <a class="citation" href="#kircher2014general">(Kircher et al., 2014)</a> is an important bioinformatics tool
that exemplifies pathogenicity prediction. 
While CADD is a valuable
scoring method, its purpose is not to predict likelihood of variation.
Similarly, MRF scoring is not a measure of pathogenicity. 
MRF scoring
may be complemented by tools for scoring variant deleteriousness. 
We
compare MRF to the PHRED-scaled CADD scores for all possible SNV
positions in <em>RAG1</em> (**Fig.</p>

<p><img />RAG_CADD\%}**) illustrating that
pathogenicity prediction cannot account for mutation probability.
Combining both methods allows researchers to identify highly probable
mutations before querying predicted pathogenicity.</p>

<p>![<em>RAG1</em> PHRED-scaled CADD score versus GnomAD conservation rate and MRF

Allele frequency conservation rate (<strong>top</strong>) is vastly important

clinically and may require pre-emptive functional
investigation.[%}{data-label=”fig:RAG_CADD”}%}(RAG_CADD)</p>

<p>To further develop this concept, we first annotated variants with MRF
likelihood scores and pathogenic prediction PHRED-scaled CADD scores
(<strong>Figure 
<img />hgmd_combined_methods\%}</strong>), and secondly, performed a
manual investigation of the clinical relevance of top candidates
(<strong>Table hgmd_data\%}</strong>). 
We used HGMD as an unbiased source of
known RAG deficiency cases in both instances. 
CADD score was very
successful at predicting the pathogenicity of a variant, (a high-density
cluster of variants with CADD scores &gt;25) as shown in <strong>red</strong> in</p>
<h2 id="figure-4">Figure</h2>
<p><img />hgmd_combined_methods\%} (i)<strong>. 
At about the same rate,
CADD score also predicted variants as pathogenic that are, to date,
unreported (as **pink</strong> in **Fig.</p>

<p><img />hgmd_combined_methods\%}
(i)<strong>). 
Indeed, those unreported variants may very well be pathogenic.
However, the likelihood of each mutation varies. 
As such, we developed
the MRF score to account for that likelihood. 
As expected, the
likelihood of mutations occurring that were unreported was low according
to MRF (</strong>Fig.</p>

<p><img />hgmd_combined_methods\%} (ii)<strong>, **pink</strong>), while
the mutations which did occur were highly enriched in at high MRF scores
(**Fig.</p>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>

<p>Determining disease-causing variants for functional analysis typically
aims to target conserved gene regions. 
On GnomAD 56% of <em>RAG1</em> (approx.
246,000 alleles) is conserved with no reported variants. 
Functional
validation of unknown variants in genes with this level purifying
selection is generally infeasible. 
Furthermore, we saw that a vast
number of candidates are “predicted pathogenic” by commonly used
pathogenicity tools, which may indeed be damaging but unlikely to occur.
To overcome the challenge of manual selection we quantified the
likelihood of mutation for each candidate variant.</p>

<p>Targeting clearly defined regions with high MRF scores allows for
functional validation studies tailored to the most clinically relevant
protein regions. 
An example of high MRF score clustering occurred in the
RAG1 catalytic RNase H (RNH) domain at p.Ser638-Leu658 which is also
considered a conserved <em>Transib</em> motif.</p>

<p>While many hypothetical variants with low MRF scores may be uncovered as
functionally damaging, our findings suggest that human genomic studies
will benefit by first targeting variants with the highest probability of
occurrence (gene regions with high MRF). 
<strong>Table [Table:1\%}</strong> lists the
values for calculated MRFs for RAG1 and RAG2.</p>

<p>We have presented a basic application of MRF scoring for RAG deficiency.
The method can be applied genome-wide. 
This can include phenotypically
derived weights to target candidate genes or tissue-specific epigenetic
features. 
In the state presented here, MRF scores are used for
pre-clinical studies. 
A more advanced development may allow for use in
single cases. 
During clinical investigations using personalised analysis
of patient data, further scoring methods may be applied based on disease
features. 
A patient phenotype can contribute a weight based on known
genotype correlations separating primary immunodeficiencies or
autoinflammatory diseases <a class="citation" href="#picard2018international">(Picard et al., 2018)</a>. 
For example, a
patient with autoinflammatory features may require a selection that
favors genes associated with proinflammatory disease such as <em>MEFV</em> and
<em>TNFAIP3</em>, whereas a patient with mainly immunodeficiency may have
preferential scoring for genes such as <em>BTK</em> and <em>DOCK8</em>. 
In this way, a
check-list of most likely candidates can be confirmed or excluded by
whole genome or panel sequencing. 
However, validation of these expanded
implementations requires a deeper consolidation of functional studies
than is currently available.</p>

<p>@Havrilla220814 have recently developed a method with similar possible
applications for human health mapping constrained coding regions. 
Their
study employed a method that included weighting by sequencing depth.
Similarly, genome-wide scoring may benefit from mutation significance
cut-off, which is applied for tools such as CADD, PolyPhen-2, and SIFT
<a class="citation" href="#itan2016mutation">(Itan et al., 2016)</a>. 
We have not included an adjustment method as our
analysis was gene-specific but implementation is advised when
calculating genome-wide MRF scores.</p>

<p>The MRF score was developed to identify the top most probable variants
that have the potential to cause disease. 
It is not a predictor of
pathogenicity. 
However, MRF may contribute to disease prediction; a
clinician may ask for the likelihood of RAG deficiency (or any other
Mendelian disease of interest) prior to examination (<em>**</em>).</p>

<p>Predicting the likelihood of discovering novel mutations has
implications in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). 
Variants with
low minor allele frequencies have a low discovery rate and low
probability of disease association <a class="citation" href="#kido2018minor">(Kido et al., 2018)</a>, an important
consideration for rare diseases such as RAG deficiency. 
An analysis of
the NHGRI-EBI catalogue data highlighted diseases whose average risk
allele frequency was low <a class="citation" href="#kido2018minor">(Kido et al., 2018)</a>. 
Autoimmune diseases had risk
allele frequencies considered low at approximately 0.4. 
Without a method
to rank most probable novel disease-causing variants, it is unlikely
that GWAS will identify very rare disease alleles (with frequencies
&lt;0.001). 
It is conceivable that a number of rare immune diseases are
attributable to polygenic rare variants. 
However, evidence for
low-frequency polygenic compounding mutations will not be available
until large, accessible genetics databases are available, exemplified by
the NIHR BioResource Rare Diseases study <a class="citation" href="#lawless2018prevalence">(Lawless et al., 2018)</a>. 
An
interesting consideration when predicting probabilities of variant
frequency, is that of protective mutations. 
Disease risk variants are
quelled at low frequency by negative selection, while protective
variants may drift at higher allele frequencies <a class="citation" href="#chan2014excess">(Chan et al., 2014)</a>.</p>

<p>The cost-effectiveness of genomic diagnostic tests is already
outperforming traditional, targeted sequencing <a class="citation" href="#payne2018cost">(Payne et al., 2018)</a>. 
Even
with substantial increases in data sharing capabilities and adoption of
clinical genomics, rare diseases due to variants of unknown significance
and low allele frequencies will remain non-actionable until reliable
predictive genomics practices are developed. 
Bioinformatics as a whole
has made staggering advances in the field of genetics
<a class="citation" href="#libbrecht2015machine">(Libbrecht &amp; Noble, 2015)</a>. 
Challenges that remain unsolved, hindering the
benefit of national or global genomics databases, include DNA data
storage and random access retrieval <a class="citation" href="#Organick114553">(Organick et al., 2017)</a>, data privacy
management <a class="citation" href="#Huang:224980">(Huang et al., 2016)</a>, and predictive genomics analysis methods.
Variant filtration in rare disease is based on reference allele
frequency, yet the result is not clinically actionable in many cases.
Development of predictive genomics tools may provide a critical role for
single patient studies and timely diagnosis <a class="citation" href="#casanova2014guidelines">(Casanova et al., 2014)</a>.</p>

that,</p>

\[{rf-igf}_{r,g} ={rf}_{r,g} \times {igf}_r\]

<p>We may view each gene as a vector with one component corresponding to each residue mutation in the gene, together with a weight for each component that is given by (1).
Therefore, we can find the overlap score
measure with the \({rf-igf}\) weight of each term in \(g\), for a query \(q\);</p>

\[\mbox{Score}(q,g)=\sum_{r\in q} \mbox{rf-igf}_{r,g}.\]

<p>In respect to MRF scoring, this information retrieval method might be
applied as follows; the \({rf-igf}\) weight of a term is the product of
its \(rf\) weight and its \(igf\) weight
(\({W}_{r,g}={rf}_{r,g} \times \log \frac{N}{{gf}_{r}}\)) or
(
\({W}_{r,g}=(1 + \log {rf}_{r,g}) \times \log \frac{N}{{gf}_{r}}\)
).
That is, firstly, the number of times a residue mutates in a gene
(
\(rf={rf}_{r,g}\)
) and secondly, the rarity of the mutation genome-wide
in \(N\) number of genes (\(igf=N/{gf}_{r}\)). 
Finally, ranking the score of
genes for a mutation query \(q\) by;
\(\mbox{Score}(q,g)=\sum_{r\in q\cap g} \mbox{rf-igf}_{r,g}\) The score
of the query (Score(\(q,g\))) equals the mutations (terms) that appear in
both the query and the gene (\(r\in q\cap g\)). 
Working out the \(rf-igf\)
weight for each of those variants (\({rf.igf}_{r,g}\)) and then summing
them (\(\sum\)) to give the score for the specific gene with respect to
the query.

<h2 id="bayesian-probability">Bayesian probability</h2>

<p>MRF score may provide a limiting component required for applying
Bayesian probability to disease prediction. 
A clinician may ask for the
likelihood of RAG deficiency (or any Mendelian disease of interest) for
a patient given a set of gene variants \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes’ theorem,
\(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}\) where \(P(H)\) is the probability of
a patient having RAG deficiency, \(P(E | H)\) is the probability of RAG
deficiency due to a set of variants that have been pre-emptively
assayed, and \(P(E)\) is the probability of having a set of gene variants.</p>

<p>\(P(H)\) is known since the rate of RAG deficiency is estimated at an
incidence of 1:181,000 <a class="citation" href="#kumanovics2017estimated">(Kumánovics et al., 2017)</a>, SCID at a rate of
1:330,000 <a class="citation" href="#kwan2014newborn">(Kwan et al., 2014)</a>, and we also recently show the rate of RAG
deficiency in adults with PID <a class="citation" href="#lawless2018prevalence">(Lawless et al., 2018)</a>. 
Being a
recessive disease, \(P(E)\) must account for biallelic variants and is the
most difficult value to determine. 
This may be found from population
genetics data for (i) the rate of two separate, compound heterozygous
variants, (ii) the rate of a homozygous variant or potential
consanguinity, or (iii) the rate of de novo variation
<a class="citation" href="#lek2016analysis">(Lek et al., 2016)</a>. 
\(P(E|H)\) would be identified where all variants are
functionally validated. 
This requires a major investment, however the
MRF score provides a good approximation.</p>
