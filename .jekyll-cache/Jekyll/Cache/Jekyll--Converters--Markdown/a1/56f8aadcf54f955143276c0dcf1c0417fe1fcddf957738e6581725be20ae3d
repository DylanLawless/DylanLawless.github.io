<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>With the popularisation of commercial genetics services, more and more people are now able to ‚Äúdecode‚Äù their genetic data.
Questions that might arise from this information include ‚Äúdo I have potentially disease-causing variants that can be treated with a drug?‚Äù, or ‚Äúam I taking a drug that will be affected by my genetics?‚Äù.
To tackle such questions with an example, we use public data in combination with pharmacogenomics.
Outside of genotype data (offered by <a href="https://www.23andme.com">23andMe</a> for example), the most common file type will be VCF:
<a href="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/1268/what-is-a-vcf-and-how-should-i-interpret-it">What is a vcf and how should I interpret it?</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a data source with different genetic data files.
<a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/public_genetic_data">https://my.pgp-hms.org/public_genetic_data</a>.
To check that it works OK, I tried a quick version of this challenge.
I picked the first whole genome VCF file that I saw (hu24385B 2019-04-07.vcf.g_z)
<a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu24385B">https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu24385B</a>. 
The VCF has 3,461,639 variants.
VCF files can contain a large range of information for each variant, however only the first 7 column are strictly neccessary; Chromosome, position, ID, Reference, Alternate, Qulaity, Filter, info. 
<a href="https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/1268/what-is-a-vcf-and-how-should-i-interpret-it">The details are explained on this GATK forum post.</a>.
Annotation information about the gene name (or related diseases) is often not present when the VCF is generated and only added later.
Therefore the most common input source may be lacking gene symbols.
To get the gene names of a single file, the simplest way was is to upload a VCF (or a part of it) to <a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/VEP/">Variant Effect Predictor</a> to get the gene symbol (and any other information that you wish).
<img src="https://dylanlawlessblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/screenshot-2019-05-07-at-17.01.45.png" width="80%" /><br />
<img src="https://dylanlawlessblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/screenshot-2019-05-07-at-17.01.58.png" width="80%" /></p>

<p>To reduce the time and output you can limit the options.
Split the file and run in batches to save time.
Here I tried the first ~1800 variants.</p>

<p><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">head -2000 56001801068861_WGZ.snp.vcf &gt; test.vcf</code></p>

<p><br />
And then annotated that extract with <a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/VEP/">Variant Effect Predictor.</a>
The results would be retained by a URL address such as this, for a few days, but will be deleted by the time your read this.<br />
<a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/VEP/Results?db=core;tl=jNYYW5ONeVFYnaMM-5265700">http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/VEP/Results?db=core;tl=jNYYW5ONeVFYnaMM-5265700</a>

<p>(Make certain you use the same reference genome as used on the input data).
The VCF file was made using reference genome GRCh37.
Therefore the Ensembl/VEP website URL should be for that genome build (grch37, not the default GRCh38).</p>

<h1 id="running-a-real-example">Running a real example</h1>
<p>If you would like to try this using a whole genome using the Ensembl web interface you will need to split your VCF into smaller block first.
For routine usage the command-line version of VEP and it‚Äôs databases should be installed on run locally.
There are several bioinformatics tools that are commonly used for manipulating genetic file formats such as VCFtools. 
To get a real understanding of the data type, I inlcude here a method using command line bash to split a VCF file into smaller blocks. 
A bash script is printed below where I use very mainstream traditional command-line tools to wrangle data, including 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gunzip</a>
to unzip compressed files, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wc_(Unix)">wc</a>
to could lines, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)">cat</a>
to print a file, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(Unix)">head</a>
to read the top of a file, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a>
to edit lines, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">awk</a>
for data extraction, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a>
which is not used here but it fits well with these other tools - for text search.
Creating a file containing the code below and ending with the filename extension with ‚Äú.sh‚Äù will allow it to be run by your terminal, in this case using the bash language.
I encourage you to read each line and figure out what should happen. If it makes sense then it is reasonable to swap such a manual method with a more efficient specialised tool.</p>

<h1 id="comparing-annotated-genetic-data-to-drug-lists">Comparing annotated genetic data to drug lists</h1>
<p>Uploading either a small example or your split-whole-genome example, VEP will process the data and annotate it will whatever features you require, including gene names, variant consequence, pahtnogenicy prediction, etc.
The next aim will be to see if any of your output genes are also present in your drug-gene database.
The method will require merging both dataset (gene and drug datasets) based on shared features. 
A simple sanity test would be useful first:</p>

<h2 id="small-example-check-of-gene-list-versus-drug-gene-list">Small example check of gene list versus drug-gene list</h2>
<p>From the VEP output I extracted the gene symbols column and compared against a list of druggable target genes from 
<a href="https://www.drugbank.ca">DrugBank</a>
(because I happen to have their data on hand, FDA may be more reliable).
I used another command-line method to do this efficienctly:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cut</span> <span class="nt">-f1</span> <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="s2">","</span> vep_output_file.csv | <span class="nb">uniq</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> unique.genes.txt
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li>Cut column 1 (f1)</li>
  <li>with a delimiter comma (,)</li>
  <li>from the vep output csv file (or tsv, or text file)</li>
  <li>then pipe (|) that result into another program (sort) to sort the result in alphabetic order</li>
  <li>pipe (|) again this result into(uniq)</li>
  <li>so that only one unique gene name is output</li>
  <li>then (&gt;) write the output into the new file ‚Äúunique.genes.txt‚Äù.<br />
<br />
Repeat the same type of method on the DrugBank dataset to get a list of the gene names contained in DrugBank into a file called ‚Äúunique.druggable.txt‚Äù
The next command will then compare both lists.
<br />
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sort </span>unique.genes.txt unique.druggable.txt | <span class="nb">uniq</span> <span class="nt">-c</span> <span class="nt">-i</span> | <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-v</span> <span class="s1">'1 '</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>This command also used ‚Äúuniq -c‚Äù to count how many times each gen name occurs and then ‚Äúgrep -v ‚Äò1 ‚Äò‚Äù meaning ignore genes that are only present 1 time. 
We want the genes that are present twice, once in each list.
The genes which were in present in both the variant list and DrugBank list are:<br />
From a 2,000 line VCF file = 
<a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/bio_entities/BE0003599">GABRD</a>,
<a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/bio_entities/BE0004895">PRKCZ</a>,
<a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/bio_entities/BE0000495">SCNN1D</a><br />
From a 10,000 VCF line file = 
<a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/bio_entities/BE0003599">GABRD</a>,

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now that a small example has shown us the logic of the process, we can try a more complex real-world example. 
The following R language script is used to merge the VEP annotated VCF file with a DrugBank database based on the gene names that are common to both datasets.
Read each line and try to understand the process. 
The are many alternative ways to do the same thing in different programming languages. 
This example is done using R. 
I recommending installing R and then installing R studio to edit and run your commands.</p>

<p>If you complete this process the output will contain a perfectly merged dataset.
So in this simple example it takes just 5 minutes to get from a real genome VCF to possibly druggable target genes (see further note on <em>drug indication</em> below).
The difficulty lies downstream in interpreting which variants can have an effect that would justify the use of the drug.
Anyone implementing a usable version of this method will incur several obstacles;
e.g. are non-coding or synonymous variants worth reporting?, genes have multiple transcripts which means one variant can be both coding and non-coding depending on transcript splicing, etc.

There are many layers to a this problem to create a usable product.
For example, how to integrate pharmacodynamics, covariats to drug response, contraindications, variant pathogenicity, etc.
However, this is a good start as a learning experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/VEP/">Variant Effect Predictor</a> is very useful.
Note: For a real product, the code can run offline (a perl program with a few local library dependencies).
The databases/cache that it uses are a bit too large to include on in a user software.
In the real world you would have to send <em>anonymised</em> packets from the user via an API for accessing the genomic databases hosted on your servers.

<p>My example used <a href="https://www.drugbank.ca">DrugBank</a> for pharmacogenomic information.
However, it may be safest to use the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-research-drugs/table-pharmacogenomic-biomarkers-drug-labeling">FDA information</a> as the primary source, but including <a href="https://www.drugbank.ca">DrugBank</a> info is no problem.
Drugs might be either a treatment for a genetic determinant, or a warning for drug usage in someone who also has a genetic variation that might effect their treatment.
The ‚ÄúLabelling Section‚Äù listed by FDA might offer the best information.

<h1 id="optimising-vcf-annotation">Optimising VCF annotation</h1>
<p>The slowest part of the method is VCF annotation.
You can significantly increase the speed by first reducing the input to contain only regions of interst.
That is, prepare a list of coordinates for each gene, and select for those regions in your input VCF or genotype data before annotation (VEP).</p>

<h1 id="how-to-get-coordinates-for-a-gene-list">How to get coordinates for a gene list</h1>
<p>Use Biomart.
Their main server was down when I tried, so I went via Ensembl, data access section:<br />
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/index.html">http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/index.html</a><br />
The use the BioMart data mining tool<br />
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/28fdaf82da6c02dc5892f99b757e2c44">http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/28fdaf82da6c02dc5892f99b757e2c44</a><br />
I actually needed the positions using GRCh37 (rather than 38), so I switched to the old Ensembl using<br />
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/tutorials/grch37.html">http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/tutorials/grch37.html</a><br />
to get to <a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/index.html">http://grch37.ensembl.org/index.html</a> 
then the Biomart section<br />

<p>Choose DataBase: Genes 93 Dataset: Human Filter -&gt; Gene -&gt; Input external ref ID list -&gt; (change dropdown) Gene
Name paste your list.
e.g. VPS45 PSMB8 BLNK NEFL NLRP7 SMAD4 PSMB9<br />
To set the output type: Attributes -&gt; Gene -&gt; select ‚Äúgene start‚Äù, ‚Äúgene stop‚Äù, ‚Äúgene name‚Äù, or anything extra.
Select the ‚ÄúResults‚Äù button at the top and export.
The results can be tsv or csv.
You would have to figure out how to extract the regions from the vcf (sed, grep, awk, R code, etc.).
When I needed this, I used my own tools which required converting to format like this ‚ÄúX:1-2000‚Äù, and ordered by number and alphabetic (some positions in the reference genome were patches added later and have an alphanumeric instead of the normal chromosome).
If you use this list to extract regions from a VCF, remember to include all the original VCF header information.</p>

<h1 id="extracting-regions-from-a-vcf-using-a-bed-file">Extracting regions from a VCF using a bed file</h1>
<p>The early part of this tutorial shows how old-school command line tools can be used to extract data. 
Indeed, this may be computationally most efficient but there are some specialised tools that make the process easier in general.
You can use VCFtools to extract specified regions.<br />
<a href="https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html">https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html</a><br />
You could use a list of defined genome position to reduce the size of your dataset. 
The defined genomic coordinates are generally supplied in a file format called the (BED file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BED_(file_format))
Note that sometimes the bed file ‚Äúchrom‚Äù ID - the name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3) does not match if the VCF file uses ‚Äú3‚Äù instead of ‚Äúchr3‚Äù.
You might need to edit the bed.
My bed file was like this:<br />
(tab spaced), ref.bed<br />
<br />
chrom    chromStart    chromEnd<br />
1    3549    13555<br />
<br />
And this command ran OK for me to give ‚Äúoutput_prefix.recode.vcf‚Äù<br /></p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$:</span>~/tools/vcftools_0.1.13/bin <span class="se">\</span>
./vcftools <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nt">--vcf</span> ~/input.vcf <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nt">--bed</span> ~/ref.bed <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nt">--out</span> output_prefix <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nt">--recode</span> <span class="nt">--keep-INFO-all</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This new VCF will now only contain gene regions that are potentially ‚Äúdruggable‚Äù, or at least included on the FDA list.
VCF annotation will be <em>much faster</em> than annotation of the whole genome.</p>

<h1 id="unknown-variants">Unknown variants</h1>
<p>In the majority of situations you will be stuck with <em>variants of unknown significance</em>.
In the absence of tailored analysis and interpretation of each invidual variant, one must often rank unknown variants based on a predicted pathogenicity.
Carefully consider that predictions can be completed wrong and address how such an annotation should be presented. 
One can rank unknown variants based on PHRED-scaled CADD score, highest being more predicted pathogenic.
https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/info<br />
<a href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/">Polyphen</a> gives a predicted outcome label and a probability score 0-1 from benign to probably damaging.
See what other pathogenicity prediction tools you can find and estimate how widespread/accepted their usage is.</p>

<h1 id="drug-indication-1">Drug indication</h1>
<p>The indication or warning can be difficult to automate.
For the example drug<br />
<a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB11595">https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB11595</a><br />
the section ‚ÄúPharmacology‚Äù ‚ÄúIndication‚Äù has the Indication info.<br />
The FDA label is contained as a PDF attachment in the section ‚ÄúREFERENCES‚Äù FDA label Download (245 KB).</p>

<p>If I had to automate the process I would add a URL link for each drug:<br />
for gene name CD274<br />
the drugbank column Drug IDs has these:<br />
DB11595; DB11714; DB11945<br />
and for each ID you could append the ID onto the drugbank URL to link to the webpage https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/</p>

<p>You can do this in R with some technical how-to reading, or do it manually for a quick example like this and removing space to create a web URL.<br />
URL				Drug IDs<br />
https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/	DB00303<br />
https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/	DB00114<br />
https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/	DB00142<br />
https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/	DB01839<br />
https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/	DB00125</p>

<p>I do not suggest this, but if you had to automate subsection requests for real:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[1] download the whole database (probably a big table sized &gt;100MB) and</li>
  <li>[2] for every query (the Drug ID) extract the sections of interest (indication,  Biologic Classification, Description,  FDA label, etc.)</li>
  <li>
    <p>[3] display each section as additional columns in candidate genes table.</p>
  </li>
  <li>[1] would be here: https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/latest</li>
  <li>[2] would be like this: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp
Look at example 2, your database request might be something like:
[get food name = Belgian Waffles, description] or
[get drug ID = DB11595, indication,  Biologic Classification, Description,  FDA label.]</li>
  <li>[3] for every line in the gene candidate table, do this query request and output the result into the same row.<br />
The final table would be something that includes colunm headers like:<br />
Gene, consequence, variant, amino acid, genome position, CADD, DrugBank ID, Description, Indication, FDA label PDF link, etc.
This table could be ranked based on consequence, CADD score.
The top couple of rows then might be converted into a more readable format like a PDF.</li>
</ul>
